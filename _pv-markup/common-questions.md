# My Vision

Our world-class color techs can best match your vision when you provide the road map! And the best road maps include both **preference images** and **written preferences**.

## What are preference images + why should I send them in?

When scanning by hand, there are many color and density variations we can make within a single frame. Your preference images serve as style references so we might best match your scans to your **creative vision**.

We recommend you send us **3-5 preference images** to keep on file. These images can be from your own film portfolio or from another film photographer whom you admire.

When choosing preference images, the most important aspect to consider is **skin tones**. Pick images where your subject fills the majority of the frame and has the **skin tones**, **density** and **contrast level** you are striving to achieve.

## What should I write under "Anything else we should know?"

Focus on describing your **_overall ideal image_**. 
- Warm / cool / neutral
- Dark + moody / light + airy
- Details in shadows / shadows nearly black
- Retain details in highlights / blown-out highlights OK
- Avoid vague descriptions open to interpretation (i.e. "masculine," "romantic")

When it comes to **_skin tones_**, let your **_preference images_** speak to the tones you desire. Don't try to describe them here. Instead, focus on the overall image. 

## How do I update/change my preference images?
**New customer?** First, [create an account]({{ site.baseurl }}/create-account). *Then*, [submit your preference images]({{ site.baseurl }}/submit-preference-images).
**Current customers** may [update preference images]({{ site.baseurl }}/submit-preference-images) or email them as an attachment to [{{ site.company-info.email }}](mailto:{{ site.company-info.email }}).

# The Experience

## How do I know my film has arrived?
Once your film arrives in lab, you will receive a confirmation email at the address you provided on your [order form]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf). This email includes your order number and the job's total cost.

## How do I receive my scans?
Once your scans are complete, you will receive an email to the address you provided on your [order form]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf). This email includes a link to view and download your images via [Box](http://box.com), a simple online file sharing system that keeps all your orders organized in your own folder free of charge. And, if you provide a job reference name on your [order form]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf), your [Box](http://box.com) order folder will be titled the same!

## Will my scans be rotated and numbered?
Yes! Every scan arrives rotated and organized by roll number and frame number (i.e. XXXXX-xx.jpg) at no charge. [Ergo](http://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ergo), if you number your rolls (which BTW, we *highly* recommend) your scans will be uploaded in chronological order. Pretty cool, huh?

## What if I have a problem with my order?
If you have any questions, concerns or difficulties at any time, please contact us as soon as possible via phone at [{{ site.company-info.display-phone }}](tel:{{ site.company-info.phone }}) or email at [{{ site.company-info.email }}](mailto:{{ site.company-info.email }}). We will do everything we can to ensure you are happy with your order!

## How do I order prints?
Proof prints may be requested via your [order form]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf) when you send in your film. Prefer to view your scans prior to ordering prints? Not a problem! You may [order prints]({{ site.baseurl }}/ordering/) from us anytime online from both film and digital. See [print pricing]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/print-services).

## How do I get my negatives back?
We will hold your negatives based on the Ship Back preference marked on your [Order Form]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf). Negatives are shipped back via USPS Priority Flat Rate shipping to reduce costs to you. We will charge your card on file at time of shipment. *For international shipping*, these prices will vary.

| **Ship Back Options** |   |
| --- | :---: |
| **2 weeks** | $6.50 |
| **Fill 2" Flat Rate box** | $10.00 |
| **Fill 4" Flat Rate box** | $20.00 |
| **End of Year** | Price varies |

## How are my negatives handled + organized?
We take the utmost care with your film! Negatives are carefully cut, sleeved and organized by hand at no charge. If your rolls are numbered (which BTW, we *highly* recommend) they will also be kept in numerical order.

# Exposure Reference Sheets

## What are they?
When shooting film, your negatives act as your road map to understanding the connection between how you expose your film and your scan results. [Exposure Reference Sheets]({{ site.baseurl }}/exposure-reference-sheet) are provided for every roll within your order's [Box](http://box.com) folder. They are designed to help you better understand the relationship between your exposures and scans at a glance.

## How do I read them?
[Exposure Reference Sheets]({{ site.baseurl }}/exposure-reference-sheet) provide a thumbnail of every frame in your roll, allowing you to clearly and easily see how you exposed your film. Frames that are light with little detail represent overexposure, while frames that are dark with lots of detail represent underexposure.

## How large are your scans?
Resolution matters. That's why our normal scans give you the freedom to print stunning 20x24s straight away, while our large scans can easily grace a billboard.

| **Film Size** | **Format** | **Normal Scan** | **Large Scan** |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **35mm** | 4x6 | 2400x3600 | 3600x5400 |
| **120 / 220** | 6x4.5 | 2700x3600 | 3600x4800 |
| **120 / 220** | 6x6 | 2700x2700 | 3600x3600 |
| **120 / 220** | 6x7 | 2700x3150 | 3600x4200 |
| **120 / 220** | 6x8 | 2700x3600 | 3600x4800 |
*All scan resolutions are approximate. Slight variations are normal.*

## What scanners do you use?
Every roll of film is scanned by hand on the renowned Fuji Frontier SP3000 or Noritsu S-1800. Both are excellent tools to help you reach your vision! You may choose between either on your [order form]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf). However, keep in mind there are certain film stocks that will always be scanned on the Noritsu: Portra160, Ektar100 and all black + white stocks.

## Do you offer push/pull processing?
Yes, we can push or pull film up to 3 stops. Indicate on your [order form]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf) whether your film needs to be pushed or pulled and by how many stops (i.e. Push +2 or Pull -1). Also, please indicate which roll you need pushed or pulled by placing a **rubber band** around it. Push/pull processing is $3.00 per roll.

## How do you process Ilford Delta 3200?
We process Delta 3200 at 3200 unless you indicate otherwise. Please note on your [order form]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf) how you rated your 3200.

## Do you process + scan E-6 slide film?
Sadly, we no longer process E-6, but we do scan it.
