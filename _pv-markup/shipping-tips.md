## Use a zip-close bag
Liquids can be surprisingly harmful to unprocessed film. Placing your **film + order form** inside a plastic zip-close bag gives you added peace of mind and protects your investment.

## Use a box + plenty of cushioning
We've seen more than one roll of film lost into the postal abyss because it was sent in a flimsy envelope. Don't be that guy! Place your _bagged_ film + order form inside a **box** and use **plenty of cushioning** to ensure your film's safe journey. (Pro tip: [USPS Priority Mail boxes](http://store.usps.com/store/results/free-shipping-supplies/shipping-supplies/_/N-alnx4jZ7d0v8v) are free!)

## Get a tracking number
We _highly recommend_ you send your film via a trackable method to ensure its safe arrival. Your film is precious cargo! Generally, we have found USPS Priority Mail to be the most economical choice. 

## Sending in more than one shoot?
Not a problem! Please fill out **one order form per shoot** and **separate** each shoot + order form into its own zip-close bag.

## Where do I send my film?
Download our **[pre-addressed shipping label](/images/PhotoVision+Mailing+Label.pdf)** or hand-address your package in stunning calligraphy to:
**Attn: Film Crew**
**PhotoVision**
**3775 Market St NE**
**Salem, OR 97301**
