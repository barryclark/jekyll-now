      <description>Obtained a much deeper understanding of AWS and especially its capabilities and limitations with respect to securing cloud workloads. A much deeper dive into the services offered by AWS and how a broad collection of those services come together to form solution stacks. It also provides the students with much needed detail on migrating workloads to the cloud, where there is still high demand at present with regards to cloud projects.</description>

      <description>Excellent course to learn the intricacies of AWS and round out the knowledge gained on the Job. Using AWS day to day for a number of years on mainly development oriented projects its easy to overlook the more infrastructure targeted services. This course gives an understanding of those offerings and places them in context to aid in their understanding.</description>
