      <description>An excellent introduction to the ways a hacker works to compromise a system. Despite it being widely disparaged by the Cybersecurity community, I found it to be insightful and good all-round introductory course. There are some questions around the dubious title and the format of the exam, but content is valid and useful especially for someone without a background in offensive security.</description>

      <description>A very insightful course into art of computer forensics and the techniques that are used to catch hackers. Very interesting to take the knowledge gained here and work out ways to evade them, excellent course to take that stage further and develop the adversarial mindset.</description>
