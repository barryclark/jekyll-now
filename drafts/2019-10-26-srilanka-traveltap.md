description: Finding clean drinking water in Sri Lanka, without single-use disposable plastic bottles 
---

Have you always assumed that if it is not safe to drink the tap water then you need to rely on bottled water? In our experience that is not always the case. There are often better, less wasteful alternatives. 

For longer term or regular travellers the best option is to have your own water purifier bottle or system like a steri-pen so you are always covered. But if you don’t have one, never fear.

In Sri Lanka we discovered there are many water re-fill stations where you can fill-up, rather than purchasing bottled water all the time. Below are four popular tourist destinations where you will find refill stations. These are just a few examples that we visited and no doubt there are many more options around the country. If you know of any let me know and I can add them to the list. 

## Arugambay 

On the main street in Arugambay you will find a free water refill station. 

### How we discovered this
We simply walked past it on our way to lunch. We later learned that many local businesses on the street refill here. We had already purchased a 5 litre bottle of water from the super market. So we took that bottle and a smaller bottle to re-fill several times during the rest of our stay. There is a donation box where you can make a contribution towards the plastic reduction initiative.

## Trincomalee 

Verified clean water lines are installed at most accomodation and restaurants in the area. Ask your accomodation if they have a verified clean water line where you can re-fill your bottle. 

### How we discovered this 

During our stay at Nilaveli Beach we learned that most restaurants and hotels are required to have a verified clean water line. We were chatting with a restaurant owner about plastic pollution and he told us most places in the area have something called a 'sofia line’ that provides verified clean water to the property. A what in the who know?! How did we not know about this. We asked our guest house and sure enough they had a line and showed us where we could refill our bottles. They told us it was mandatory for them to have that water line. It was separate water line to the guest rooms and there was only one tap available outside (and one in the Kitchen). The water tasted great and we had no issues.  

## Anuradhapura 

You can refill at local general stores in town for 3 LKR per litre. A one litre plastic bottle is about 70 LKR, so 3 LKR is quite a saving!

### How we discovered this
We asked if the guest house had a clean water line like in Trinco. Our host said that wasn’t available in the area, and told us he re-fills his water drums for the kitchen in town for 3 LKR per litre. He took us to the general store to re-fill our water that afternoon (on our way to sightseeing) and even lent us one of his 7 litre drums to use during our stay. So ask your accommodation where you can refill or if you can refill from their clean water supply (Depending on the situation, you could offer an amount, like 5 LKR per litre, to cover water costs). 

## Sigiriya 

There are at least two re-fill stations here, one in the Village and one at the main entrance to Lion Rock. 

### How we discovered this
Venturing out to dinner we were delighted to stumble across a water station outside the school in Sigirya Village. The next day we took our bottles and refilled them before visiting Lion Rock. We could have saved ourselves the extra walk however because on arrival to Lion Rock we discovered there was another refill station inside the main tourist entrance! We thought this was great but we wondered how people would know about this in advance? At least they can refill here rather than buy more water later on. And hopefully it is only a matter of time before it is more widely publicised.

## Unawatuna Beach, Galle
The hideout cafe and restuarant

## Mirissa

Ourworld wifi cafe
Homestay - government water / water board line. Technically it comes out of a tap but it is not standard "tap water". It is a safe drinking water line approved by the Sri Lanka government.

So now you know, its up to all of us to blow this bottled water myth right out of the water!

## Dickwella
Stay at Peakhouse for all your filtered water needs.
 
## Path forward

Plastic bottles and straws are pulluting our landscapes and choking our oceans.  This is completely unnecessary. It is possible for almost every accomodation provider and restaurant to provide clean drinking water and re-usable straws (if any straw is necessary) for their customers at very low cost.

For example, if you already have clean water supply for the kitchen, why not for drinking? If you already provide re-usable glasses and cutlerly, why not a re-usable straw? It is really that simple.

But a conscious effort is needed to move away from the single-use plastic habit we have all developed.

##Getting the message out

Would you find it useful if Trip Advisor, Booking.com, Google Reviews, AirBNB and so on listed "water re-fill station" as a facility provided by the accomodation or restaurant?
