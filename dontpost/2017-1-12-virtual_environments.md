In order to leave your virtual environment, just run deactivate, and then run source env/bin/activate when you are ready to work on your project again.


Install with:
conda create -n py27 python=2.7 anaconda


To activate python 2.7, from a command line, just type:
> activate py27
To deactivate this environment, use:
> deactivate py27


Once you've activated python 2.7, you can open jupyter notebooks simply by running "jupyter notebook"
