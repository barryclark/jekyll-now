## What is Copyright?
- The sole right to produce or reproduce a work or a substantial part of it in any form.
- The right to perform the work or any substantial part of it.
- If the work is unpublished, copyright includes the right to publish the work or any substantial part of it.

See:
- [A guide to copyright](http://www.cipo.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipoInternet-Internetopic.nsf/eng/h_wr02281.html) (Gov. of Canada)
- [Canadian Intellectual Property Office](http://www.cipo.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipoInternet-Internetopic.nsf/eng/home)

## Copyright Protects:
- literary works 
  - e.g. books, pamphlets, computer programs and other works consisting of text
- dramatic works
  - e.g. films, plays, screenplays and scripts
- musical works
- artistic works
  - e.g. paintings, drawings, maps, photographs, sculptures and plans
- performers’ performances
- sound recordings
- communication signals (radio waves)

## Registration
Registration is not required for protection in Canada. Copyright exists automatically when an original work or other subject-matter is created, provided the conditions set out in the Copyright Act have been met.

## Length of Copyright
- Lasts for the life of the author, plus
- the remainder of the calendar year in which the author dies, plus
- 50 years following the end of that calendar year.

In other words, protection will expire on December 31st of the 50th year after the author dies. _If a corporation is the author, copyright lasts for 50 years after publication._

## Copyright Mark
- Marking a work with the copyright symbol is not mandatory under Canadian copyright law but some other countries do require it.
- The marking consists of the symbol ©, the name of the copyright owner and the year of first publication.
- Marking a work with this symbol serves as a general reminder to everyone that the work is protected by copyright. You can use this symbol even if the work is not registered.

## Fair Dealing
In Canada, it does not infringe on copyright to use copyright material for these purposes:
- research 
- private study 
- education 
- parody
- satire
- criticism 
- review
- news reporting

In the US, they have Fair Use; it's similar but more flexible.

## Considerations for Fair Dealing
1. The purpose of the dealing;
    - Is it for research, private study, criticism, review or news reporting, education, parody, satire? (research for profit ok)
2. The character of the dealing;
    - How many copies were made? 
    - Were these copies distributed widely or to a limited group of people? 
    - Was the copy destroyed after being used?
3. The amount of the dealing;
    - How much of the work was used? 
    - What was the importance of the infringed work?
4. Alternatives to the dealing;
    - Was a "non-copyrighted equivalent of the work" available to the user? 
    - Was the dealing "reasonably necessary to achieve the ultimate purpose"?
5. The nature of the work; and
    - Copying from a work that has never been published could be more fair than from a published work (unless confidential).
6. The effect of the dealing on the work.
    - Is it likely to a!ect the market of the original work?

## Public Domain
When a work is declared in the public domain, it is free for use by anyone for any purpose without restriction under copyright law. Public domain is the purest form of open/free, since no one owns or controls the material in any way.

A work is declared into the public domain:
- 50 years after publication if it was subject to Crown Copyright;
- 50 years after the death of its creator (on Dec 31st);
- 50 years after publication where the creator is unknown, or (if not published) 75 years after its creation;
- at the discretion of the creator.
