  <span>“I'm <strong>Niklas Cölle</strong>, the team's project leader. I'm responsible for the satellite's eletronics and control units. However, I also help with software development. I've always been interested in aerospace engineering and therefore wanted to work on a project like this one.”</span>

  <span>“My name is <strong>Leon Hauser</strong>. In 2018, I already assumed the role of the ‘structural engineer’ (since I'm interested in an engineer's career); I'm responsible for the construction this year as well. I joined the project because I've been interested in the construction of aerospace vehicles for a long time and couldn't resign such an opportunity.”</span>
