What is a Cansat?
--------------------

A Cansat is a capsule the size of a standard soda can. Using a small rocket
it is launched to a height of about 1000m and then glides back down on a parachute.
The sensors on bord provide various data about the environment, such as temperature, pressure, position and  more.
This data is either transmitted in real time to a ground station or stored in the capsule and collected after
the landing.

More information about the challenge can be found on the official Cansat 2018 competition website
at [cansat.de](https://cansat.de).


About us
---------------
We are the team Apoapsis from Vaterstetten. Our group consists of
Niklas Cölle, Thomas Schlienz, Leon Hauser and Felix Edelmann, and we all attend the 11th grade of the
Humboldt-Gymnasiums Vaterstetten.
With our CanSat we want to measure the fine dust concentration of the atmosphere in higher air layers.
The collected data will be added to a public database which will soon be added to this website.

We were mainly inspired by the project [luftdaten.info](http://luftdaten.info) of the OK Lab Stuttgart, which collects the measurements of public accessible fine dust sensors in real time and displays them on a public available map.
