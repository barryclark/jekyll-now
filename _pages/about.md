I'm an engineer who likes data and automating things.

My entire career has revolved around manufacturing; I've made things ranging from bulk aluminum to satcom equipment. Experience is generally centered around QA, process engineering, and continual improvement. I'll post cool things I find or put together here every now and then.

I've recently started making videos for Real Python, you can check out my profile [here](https://realpython.com/team/jtatusko/)!

Python, SQL, VBA.
