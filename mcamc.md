## What is MCAMC?

MCAMC brings an exciting new type of math competition to the middle school audience - one that involves working together as a team with your friends. In contrast most other competitions that only involve working independently, get ready for a day filled with collaboration and action!

## Format and Rules
MCAMC is structured into 3 rounds, each round lasting 1 hour each. Form teams of 4-6 students from grades 6-8 and compete together!

### Individual Round
The Individual Round comes first and might be something familiar — 20 questions spanning various topics. The questions will be similar in difficulty to the AMC 8.

### Team Round
In the Team Round, each team of 4-6 students works together to solve another set of 20 questions, but with a twist! This time, all 20 questions are related to one topic — a topic that you've probably never worked with before. We'll give you lots of background information to help you solve these 20 questions. This round is not just about testing what you know, but also about learning new things and playing around with new ideas!

### Live Round
In the Live Round, each team will again work together, and the style of the questions will be similar to the style of the Individual Round, just a little harder now because you can work together as a team. The twist comes in the format.

All teams gather together in large rooms and compete live, with scores displayed in real-time on screens and projectors. Several tables in the room are set up with graders and questions. Questions come in sets of 3, and there are 8 sets of questions. When the round starts, each team sends one person to pick up the first set of questions and then return back to their team. The team works together to solve these 3 questions, and when the team is done, they send someone to submit their answers and recieve the next set of questions. Answers may not be changed after they are submitted, and answers will be graded on the spot, with the results immediately displayed on screens and projectors around the room. 

As a side note, at several high school competitions, the Live Round is consistently the most exciting and engaging round. We're proud to be the first middle school math competition to our knowledge that offers a Live Round, so we hope that you enjoy it!

### Scoring
We designed our scoring system to give more points to harder questions, as well as to prevent ties. Each round (individual, team, and live) is first scored separately, then roughly averaged for an overall score. 

{: .question}
**Show scoring specifics**

{: .answer}
For the Individual Round, for each question, each student recieves $$\frac{1}{p + 0.25}$$ points for answering correctly, where $$p$$ is the fraction of students who answered the question correctly. For the Team Round, for each question, the team similarly recieves $$\frac{1}{p + 0.25}$$ points for answering correctly. For the Live Round, each question will have a point value written next to it, which increase with every set. The overall team score is $$100(\frac{I}{I*} + \frac{T}{T*} + \frac{L}{L*})$$, where $$I$$, $$T$$, and $$L$$ are the team's individual average, team, and live scores, and $$I*$$, $$T*$$, and $$L*$$ are the top individual average, team, and live scores across all teams.

### Awards
Both team awards and individual awards will be given. Please stay tuned for details.
<!-- Awards will be given to the top 15 individuals, the top 10 teams in Team Round, the top 10 teams in Live Round, and the top 10 teams overall. Additional prizes will be given to the top 5 individuals and top 5 teams overall. We'll be announcing what these prizes are soon, so keep an eye out! -->

### Registration

{: .question}
**Can you describe the overall registration process for schools and other organizations?**

{: .answer}
Each organization submits one registration form. The organization will be asked to designate a coach that will receive communications from MCAMC, as well as provide basic information about each student participating. Please see the payment section for payment details. If you have any other questions, please contact us at [mcamathleague@gmail.com](mailto:mcamathleague@gmail.com). 

{: .question}
**Can I register as individual without a team?**  

{: .answer}
Yes! If your school is not participating in MCAMC, you can register as individual. On the day of the competition, you will be matched with a team, and you will be able to participate in all rounds just like everyone else. However, if your school is participating in MCAMC, please register with your school.

{: .question}
**Our school contains grade 5 and/or grade 9. Can these students participate?**  

{: .answer}
Grade 9 students *may not* participate. Students grade 5 and under *may* participate, but the questions on the competition assume a middle school level understanding of mathematics. Younger students may find this competition too difficult.

{: .question}
**Can organizations other than schools form teams?**  

{: .answer}
Yes! Any team from anywhere may participate. However, if a student's school is participating in MCAMC, then the student should register with their school.

### Day of the Competition

{: .question}
**What should I bring?**  

{: .answer}
Just a writing utensil is good! We will provide scrap paper and anything else you might need. Calculators, protractors, and other aids are not permitted. We will regularly announce the time, but if you wish, a (non-smart) watch is also permitted.

{: .question}
**Can parents and teachers stay?**  

{: .answer}
Due to space limitations, up to one adult per team can stay. We encourage at least one adult per organization/school to stay. For students registering individually, one adult per student may stay. 

{: .question}
**Where is parking? Where is the drop-off location?**  

{: .answer}
Refering to [this map](https://www.middlesexcc.edu/campus-map/) of Middlesex County College, our high school is building AC, located on the western side of campus. Parking is available in Lots 1 and 2 (not 1B). If you are not parking, students may be dropped off directly in front of our school.

### Payment

{: .question}
**What does the overall payment process look like?**  

{: .answer}
In the registration form, the school, organization, or individual will have the ability to preorder pizza and T-shirts. The total amount owed will be displayed before the registration form is submitted. Payment (cash or check made out to Middlesex County Academy) or a guarantee of payment must be mailed to 100 Technology Drive, Edison, NJ 08837 and *received* by the indicated deadline. We will send another email when we recieve your payment or guarantee of payment. We do not accept online payments at this time. If you have any questions, please contact us at [mcamathleague@gmail.com](mailto:mcamathleague@gmail.com).

{: .question}
**How much does MCAMC cost? Can I pay at the door?**  

{: .answer}
MCAMC costs $10 per student. Payment at the door will not be accepted. Payment must be *received* by mail by the indicated deadline.

{: .question}
**What dining options are available?**  

{: .answer}
Pizza can be preordered at $12 per 18-inch pie. If you do not wish to eat pizza, the College Center ([building CC on this map](https://www.middlesexcc.edu/campus-map/)) has a food court. Prices at the food court range are around $8 per person. *Students must be accompanied by an adult if leaving designated competition areas. We will not be responsible for students who travel to the College Center or other such locations. Please take care to not get lost and return in a timely fashion. By registering for MCAMC, the organization coach or student parent agrees to these terms.*

{: .question}
**Are there T-shirts?**  

{: .answer}
Yes! T-shirts are available for $12. This year's design will be uploaded shortly. T-shirts must be preordered when registering and will not be sold the day of the competition.

### Miscellaneous

{: .question}
**Does a high score on the MCAMC guarantee admission to Middlesex County Academy?**  

{: .answer}
No, our competition is not affiliated with the admissions process of our school. However, our admissions team is well aware of the rigor and importance of math competitions in general, including but not limited to the MCAMC. We encourage those who enjoy math competions to apply!
