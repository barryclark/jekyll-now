### About Me

I'm a father of 4 great kids, husband to the most amazing woman in the world, and an overall geek. I'm a web developer by day and freelance in the toy and game industry by night.

### About A Pawn's Perspective

I've been a contributor at [Purple Pawn](http://purplepawn.com) since October 2009. Through the years I've gone from a contributor to an Editor and met many amazing people and seen lots of amazing things along the way. Over various conventions throughout the years I've stumbled upon some really good things that don't always fit on Purple Pawn, so I've had to tuck them away or push them aside. I've also met some really interesting individuals, people who's passion and creativity amaze me. I've finally decided to create a place share those things and spotlight those people.

Over time the writers at Purple Pawn have started referring to ourselves as Pawns. A Pawn's Perspective is my personal take on the world of tabletop gaming, toys, and digital gaming that I surround myself in. While I post mostly tabletop news and reviews on Purple Pawn, here I'll be posting personal insights, game unboxings, interviews, digital game streaming, varied reviews, and much more. It's by no means a replacement to my writing on Purple Pawn, but a supplement. A place to share, what I hope is, really cool stuff.

I should also mention that I don't cover a broad range of anything. You won't see all the latest board game, toy, and video game news and releases. I won't be reviewing or unboxing everything that I see/can get my hands on. If I post it here it's because I have a personal interest in it.

### Review/Preview Policy

Most products that are sent to me for review are provided free of charge. This will always be stated at the bottom of a post where this is the case. This fact does not color my opinions on said products in any way, shape, or form. There are times where I will review a product I have purchased on my own, or received as a gift. Again, this will be disclosed at the bottom of the post and does not have any bearing on the review at all.

I do also accept paid reviews. These posts will not only have this disclosed at the bottom of the post, but an icon will appear in both the post's title, headline, and overlaid on its preview thumbnail. Paid reviews may be commission based or done for a flat fee. A paid review does not guarantee a positive review.

A majority of products reviewed are final, retail products. Sometimes I will do a preview based of a prototype, or unfinished item. Again, this will be disclosed at the bottom of the post, as well as the headline.

The above items being stated, I should mention that I generally accept review products, or reach out for review products, for items I have a personal interest in. I try not to bother with things I feel I won't enjoy, or that my readership wouldn't enjoy.
