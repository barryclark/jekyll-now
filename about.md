My name is Shaun Dixon and by day I am a Test Engineer.  By night (and sometimes part of the day) I am a budding security tester. 

I have always had an interest in security especially around web applications.  But taking the leap from "interest" to actual actions only happened recently. 

I am constantly learning new things every day and I am hoping one day to make a career out of this or to at least be able to do more within my current job.  In the meantime I am just enjoying my new hobby and learning new skills.
