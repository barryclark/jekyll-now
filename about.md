Welcome to my page! I'm a software engineer from Spain, and I work as Drupal Backend developer since two and a half years ago. Also, when my contractors need it, I also code Android apps with its native SDK. Whether its PHP or Java, I'm up to the task. And whenever a chance arises, I enjoy programming some beautiful lines in Python :)

But wait, there's more! On my free time I can't stop creating 48h jam experimental games with the awesome engine Unity3D, all in C#. You may play any of these little games in these two websites:
[Itch.io](http://maesk.itch.io/)
