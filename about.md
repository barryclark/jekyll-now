I'm a Software Engineer working at Bazaarvoice and a CS graduate of Ulster University. I'm focused primarily on backend development with Java, MongoDB, AWS, Python, JavaScript and Docker. This site will probably be mostly tech focused but may contain a bit of anything and everything too. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
