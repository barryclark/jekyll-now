### About me:
I am a 3rd year Software Engineering student at the University of Southampton with a passion for technology and software developing.


### About this website:
I built this website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a simple, blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby, for personal or project sites.

**JEKYLL’S simple purpose**:
Tom Preston-Werner created Jekyll to enable people to blog using a simple static HTML website, with all of the content hosted 
and version-controlled on GitHub. The goal was to eliminate the complexity of other blogging platforms by creating a workflow
that allows you to blog like a hacker.

Conveniently, github serves this website directly from my github repo, making editing easy with a couple of well-known commands.
This also means that I don't have to deal with any hosting costs for my site.

### Plans for the website:
This project started as a way for me to get a functioning website *without* having to pay for hosting costs and I didn't expect it to be this easy. I will continue to customize the website and use it as a place to blog about my projects.
