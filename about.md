I'm recently a political science Ph.D. candidate majoring in international relations. I'm also enrolled in Social Data Analytics and Research master program. 

My research goal is to utilize machine learning skills and quantitative regression models to explore the mutual effect between the U.S. government's trade policies and the big firms' operations within the context of U.S.-China trade war and their tenser relations during the pandemic.

My career goal is to become a professional data scientist.
