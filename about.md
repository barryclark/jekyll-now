Hi, my name is Camila and this is my personal data blog.

### I like data

I like data, big data, small data, open data... you get the point. I usually write about my adventures analysing open datasets, participating in kaggle competitions or exploring new technologies. Sometimes I also do a bit of web development.

Also, python > R.

### Data + Catastrophe = Datastrophe

Catastrophe = an event causing great and usually sudden damage or suffering; a disaster.

Data is just a tool that can be used for good or bad. The name of this blog forces me to remember that datastrophes do happen and that with *big data comes big resposability*. Let's do good with data.
