I am the Director of Ecosystem at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. My
mission is to to increase the adoption of Kubernetes and cloud native by growing the community and advocating for end users.

In addition to being a prolific public speaker, I founded the Cloud Native
London meetup. We are a strong, open, diverse developer community around the
cloud native platform and technologies in London. Each monthly event gets
200-300 attendees; [come join us in London on the first Wednesday of each
month](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London)!

## Background

I spent five years at Google as a C++ engineer on Google Maps, before moving to
a storage startup to lead Product, DevOps and DevRel. I hold a Masters in 
Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, King's College.
