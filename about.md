I am an engineer and (data) science enthusiast. I am interested in understanding how learning processes can uncover hidden mechanics of the universe, be that through data science, complex systems, or energy dynamics.

### Work Experience

* 2021 - Present: __Data Scientist__ ([electricityMap](https://electricitymap.org))
  * electricityMap's mission is to organise the world's electricity data to drive the transition towards a truly decarbonised electricity system.
  * Responsible for ensuring that electricityMap's data is accurate, reliable, and timely.
  * Owning the building of the modelling infrastructure to power our estimation and forecast systems. These models allow for large scale load-shifting from e.g [Google](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/carbon-aware-computing-location/).

* 2020 - 2021 (part-time): __Data Scientist__ ([Tomorrow](https://www.tmrow.com/))
  * Tomorrow's mission is to build tools to empower people to take climate action.
  * Automating the generation of total carbon footprints, for both [North](https://www.tmrow.com/blog/sunsetting-north/) a carbon accounting app and [Bloom](https://www.tmrow.com/blog/closing-down-the-bloom-chapter/), a carbon-accounting SaaS.
  * Powering models with accurate emission factors.
