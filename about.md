Greetings!

My name is Samson Brock, and this is badMOTIVATOR.io. (badMOTIVATOR was my [Battle.net](http://battle.net/) username way back when I started playing Warcraft and Starcraft on the Undergraduate Library computers at the University of Texas at Austin.) This blog was started on June 6th, 2015, to journal my re-entry into the world of professional software engineering.

I already had about 10 years of combined experience across software engineering, IT consulting, and web development roles. It had, however, been a few years since I had programmed professionally. Technology changes, and skills rust quickly. Never one to do things half-assed, I chose to enroll at the Turing School of Software & Design to get myself back up to speed the right way.

The [Turing School of Software & Design](http://turing.io/) is a 7-month intensive full-stack web developer program. Most other developer "bootcamps" out there are only about 3 months long with varying degrees of reported quality. Jeff Casimir founded Turing School after successfully teaching and co-founding a middle school with [Teach for America](http://www.teachforamerica.org/) and creating [Hungry Academy](http://www.hungryacademy.com/), one of the very first developer bootcamps, for Living Social. He then evolved the 5-month Hungry Academy into the 6-month gSchool (now known as the [Full Stack](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/full-stack/) program) at Galvanize. Jeff parted ways with Galvanize to found a school fully focused on providing the absolute best educational experience, which became the Turing School of Software & Design. Turing School is one of the only non-profit programs of its type. It does not branch out into multiple types of businesses and locations. Everything it does is focused on providing the best educational experience possible.

This blog exists to provide some insight into my experience at the Turing School in addition to other topics generally software engineering related. Please feel free to interact with me through any of my accounts linked below.

Cheers!
