The Golang Challenge is a monthly programming challenge for **Go Programming Newbies**. 

The Golang Challenge:

* is a good idea as reading books and documentation can only take you so far when learning a new language. To really learn, you need to use the language. 
* provides a fabulous forum for using Go in the form of regular, engaging (but not arcanely difficult) challenges. Better yet, it provides feedback on how to use Go well, as each month the best solution to a challenge is chosen. 
* is a wonderful introduction to the Go language and to the Go community. 

Welcome newbies!
