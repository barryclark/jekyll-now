I am Min Shi, a Ph.D. student majoring in political science and interested in programming with Python. 

### More Information

I have learned programming with R, Stata, and also have a little bit of experience with Python, Java. I would like to make friends with those who are also beginners in programming. We could accompany each other to learn step by step.
