Discovered Buddhism in 2000, read lots of books. Finally started practicing in 2010 in various contexts (Tibetan Kagyu, Gelug, Theravada, Secular...). Settled on practicing in a Soto Zen Sangha.

I am a machine learning nerd, working on some [NLP projects](https://github.com/therabyte/matika-finder/blob/master/Proof_of_concept.ipynb) for capturing [matikas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammasa%E1%B9%85ga%E1%B9%87%C4%AB) from pali texts.

"Datayana" is a Buddhist wordplay. Hinayana, Mahayana, Vajrayana, Datayana. Making a reasonable use of digital technology to sustain healthy practice of Buddhism.

"Therabyte" is just a pseudonym. I am not actually a Thera, but the wordplay (again) was too catchy, I had to use it.
