First off, thank you for visiting my website! By clicking this page, you must have been at least slightly curious about me, so to summarize who I am in one sentence - I am a Data and Marketing enthusiast with a passion for 4 main things: travelling, food, basketball and technology (in no particular order), and my goal is to leverage data to revolutionize the way these industries connect with their consumers.
