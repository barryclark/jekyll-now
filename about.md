Hello! I'm Jay and this is my English tech [blog](/). The most popular posts here are:
* [The Illustrated Transformer](/illustrated-transformer/) (Referenced in AI/ML Courses at [MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53YvP6gdD7U&feature=youtu.be&t=334), and [Cornell](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5740/2019sp/schedule.html))
* [The Illustrated BERT, ELMo, and co.](/illustrated-bert/) (Referenced in AI/ML Courses at [Stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) and [CMU](http://phontron.com/class/nn4nlp2019/schedule/contextual-representation.html))
* [Visual and Interactive Guide to the Basics of Neural Networks](/visual-interactive-guide-basics-neural-networks/) (which was called [awesome](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/12/20/noncomprehensive-list-of-awesome/), [must share](https://www.facebook.com/kaggle/photos/a.10150387148668464.377856.135534208463/10154865388138464/?type=3&hc_ref=ARQS_GO4ZGUA8CF_Fus-jB2FVUxlkMU8UgleekyycPWbRjFoD4foj65C9vGn0s8Do6Y), [and](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154054954207143&set=a.471131017142.254979.722677142&type=3&theater) [other](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5igdix/a_visual_and_interactive_guide_to_the_basics_of/) things)


As this is my technical blog, it's probably fitting to point out some aspects of technology that fascinate me:

 * I visualize and explain machine learning concepts to thousands of students in Udacity programs like the [Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009), [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101), and [Natural Language Processing Nanodegree](https://sa.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892).
 * I help fund and accelerate the growth of cool tech companies with the [STV](https://stv.vc/) team.
 * I once founded a tech [startup](https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=128935145) where I built an extensive web app as well as apps for iOS and Android
 * Whenever I find time, I try to make tiny contributions to open source projects I love and use -- mostly documentation. For example, my [post visualizing some Pandas functions](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-pandas-pivoting-and-reshaping/) found its way to the [official documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reshaping.html).
 * I love sci-fi. I have translated the Isaac Asimov short story The Last Question to [Arabic](http://www.blogjihad.com/?p=563). I've also written a terrible sci-fi novella that I won't allow anyone to ever suffer through. Makes you appreciate how tough writing a good story is..
 * Pop culture things I love include [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)), [Berserk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk_(manga)), [Final Fantasy VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII) and its music, [Starcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft), and [Opeth](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmQSJTFZaXN85gYk6W3XbdQ).

بالاضافة إلى مدونتي التقنية هذه، لدي مدونات سابقة متناثرة في الانترنت. احدثها هي [مدونتي في كاراميلا](https://caramel.la/jalammar). بعض كتاباتي السابقة هي:

* [هل تجيد عجن البيانات؟](https://caramel.la/home/B1AeolZ2g/hl-tjyd-ajn-albyanat)
