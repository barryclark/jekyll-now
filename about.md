I’m a developer advocate at StorageOS, where I code, write and speak about storage, containers and cloud. I’m active in the developer community and speak at meetups related to Docker containers, Kubernetes, microservices, cloud native and more.

I founded the Cloud Native London meetup, the official Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Meetup group dedicated to building a strong, open, diverse developer community around the Cloud Native platform and technologies in London.

## More information

I spent five years at Google writing C++ on teams across Google Maps, and living in London and New York.

I hold a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, King’s College. My final year dissertation was on [Gesture controlled robotics using the Vicon motion capture system](https://github.com/oicheryl/cambridge/blob/master/documentation/dissertation/cjh84.pdf)
