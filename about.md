## Prospective Students

I am looking for motivated Bioinformatics, Computer Science, and Biology  graduate and undergraduate students interested in developing and applying statistical modeling approaches to understand the genetics of complex traits. Students joining our computational lab need to have good communication (both oral and written) and organizational skills. Prior coursework in genetics/genomics, statistics, and programming is preferred. Familiarity or willingness to become familiar with Linux, R, Python, and GitHub is required.

Undergraduate students working in my lab have to commit to at least 1.5 years and are expected to be in the lab 10-15 hours/week during the semester and full-time (funding is usually available) during the summer. 

Here are the questions I generally ask students who are interested in working in my lab:

- What interests you about human genetics?
- Is there a particular complex trait that interests you?
- What are your future career goals and how will research on complex trait genetics help you attain these goals?
- What are your goals and expectations about research in my lab?
- What is your computer programming experience?
- What previous experience do you have working in a lab or doing research?
- What courses have you taken in biology, statistics and computer science?
- How much time can you commit to working in the lab during the academic and summer months?
