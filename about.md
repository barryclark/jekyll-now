### Hey you! 
It seems you found my blog, that's great! Well done!
Here you can find my personal thoughts about new techonologies, system architectures and business ideas. Feel free to share your comments through this website or just send me an email!

### Ah! Before you go! 
I am a Software Engineer passionated about distributed systems, security and new business ideas. Technically, I write code and bugs in Java, and, usually, I fix them with loads of caffeine. Apart from that, I like to cook, to play the guitar, to watch Netflix and to play games.
