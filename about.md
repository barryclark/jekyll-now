I am a high school Math teacher pursuing Masters of Statistics degree at NC State University. I am now in my last semester and I am very excited to venture to a new career where I can apply what I learned about Statistics. 

### More Information

I love to travel but that is put on hold at the moment due to the pandemic and my busy schedule. I have been mostly to Asia and the Americas and I can't wait to visit Europe soon.
