I’m currently a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as CTO at [Ghost Robotics](https://www.ghostrobotics.io/).

### More information

My [lab homepage](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/group/avik/) has more information about the work I do.

Outside of lab (*...riiight*), I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee with [PADA](http://pada.org/), [fostering tiny kittens](/tags/#cats) and volunteering at [PAWS](http://phillypaws.org/). Please get in touch with me if you want to adopt a kitty friend!

I used to have pretty good (musical) keyboard chops (as much as you can without any formal music theory) and still have great [relative pitch](http://www.perfectpitch.com/perfectrelative.htm); I used to be decent at juggling (basic 3-ball patterns up to Mill's mess, 4-ball cascade on a good day), am drawn to [games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing) that [require](http://www.popcap.com/bejeweled-blitz) rapid [pattern-matching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)), and enjoy [casual arting](/tags/#art).

### Travels

I have traveled a fair amount in my life (perk of being a graduate student :wink:) and I decided to start documenting, because it reminds of the stories involved.

### Mini-resume

I'm pretty set on academia, but if you are someone who is looking to hire people and give them a big salary, maybe you want some of this info! (I realize that it's hip to have a Latex resume---but this is honestly way easier to keep up-to-date.)
