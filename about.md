Technical Architect after quarter century in this industry still coding my way through the Cloud.

### More Information

This blog name was inspired by an old film "7 Years in Tibet" like a film's character a remarkable adventure
of a man transformed by his experiences. I traded my hardware centered programming life for the cloud 7 years ago, when I joined 
a Cloud services company [Appirio](www.appirio.com) in Feb 2009, to work with Salesforce.com, AWS, Google and all things Mobile. 
It is continue to be a transformational journey filled with learning experiences. On this Cloudy path I visited many places, 
Salesforce, Force.com, Amazon Web Service, Google, Heroku and Mobile iOS apps and I hope that this will continue to be a 
journey rather than a destination. And I humbly invite you to join as companions along the way.
