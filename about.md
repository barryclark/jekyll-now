I am an aspiring data scientist. I have expertise in [mathematics teaching](https://evanrushton.blogspot.com/), [learning design](https://evanrushton.wixsite.com/learndesigntech), and organizing for [social justice](https://www.facebook.com/LosAngelesAlgebraProject/). Keep a beginner’s mindset. Live to learn. Love to teach.
