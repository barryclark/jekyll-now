## Who Am I?  
Hey **Bakar** here!  I was born and raised in Pakistan, but currently in Istanbul till 2019. I am Budding Java EE Developer as working on Software Development specifically with Spring(MVC/Security/Data) but these days I'm learning my ropes around the Enterprise *Javaverse*! 
## What do I do?
Currently I'm working as a Assistant Software Developer at [etcBase](https://www.etcbase.com/) in Istanbul, Turkey. I still have to complete my final year of studies as I am a Computer Science Student studying at [NUCES](http://nu.edu.pk/Home) after finishing my little one year venture in Istanbul.
## What do I like?
 Recently I've started to interact with multiple Open Source Projects and I must say I love it. I'm also quite fond of travelling and doing some amateur photography on my weekend strolls or day-to-day commuting(Hoping to share some photos soon) plus I've grown quite fond of retro-technology from the 80's & 90's, those are some interesting marvels of early computer engineering!
Apart from that I consider myself a student of the stoic branch of philosophy as I read the works of Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius in order to find the meaning of our Existence or if there is any!?
