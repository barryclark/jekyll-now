I am a graduate fellow working towards a PhD degree in biophysics at the Rockefeller University. My research utilizes machine learning approaches to do 3D reconstrucion of protein structures from cryo-electron microscopic images, as well as biochemical experiments to answer the how the structures we have explain the biological mechanistic working of the proteins. In particular I am interested in proteins that work as molecular machinery controlling import/export of molecules in or out of the cells.

### More Information

I completed my undegrad in biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2015. 

In my free time, I wrote a simple object-oriented python code to calculate how the change in electoral system in Thailand will influence the outcome of 2019 Thailand general election. additionally I try to analyze what direction Thai politics might undergo in near future as a result of this change. Please check out the [Blog](https://vincentk1991.github.io/)  to read about it.
