	<h1>About our Group</h1>
	<p>We meet monthly and quarterly to discuss and learn about the Linux family of operating systems and other free-and-open source software.</p>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <h3>Fort Wayne LUG 1.0</h3>
  <p>Our group was founded many years ago by Dr. Ceder of Canterbury High School, a published expert on Python, along with Rob Ludwick, and later Simón Ruíz. We met bi-monthly at one social and one learning-focused event. After many years of well-attended and productive meetings, various members began transitioning to new chapters in their lives and attendance began to decline in 2012. In 2013, LUG transitioned to a social meetup only.</p>
  <h3>Fort Wayne LUG 2.0</h3>
  <p>In 2014, with the gracious support of Sweetwater Sound, we began meeting bi-monthly again, with social meetigns at the Mad Anthony Brewing Company on Taylor street, and learning events held at Sweetwater-supplied facilities where we welcomed new members and saw old friends once again. In 2017, again due to life changes and a scarcity of monthly presenters, we again transitioned back to a social-focused monthly meet-up.</p>
  <h3>Fort Wayne LUG 3.0</h3>
  <p>Beginning in the autumn of 2017, we have decided to transition to a monthly/quarterly format, where we will continue to have social meetings once a month, with regularly-scheduled quarterly learning events with a pre-announced speaker. We are also planning other occasional special events when member schedules permit. Be sure to contact us here or on Facebook if you would like to get in touch with other members at Ohio Linux Fest 2017.</p>
