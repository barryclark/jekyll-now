# Jekyll Now

Jekyll Now makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

- No need to touch the command line
- No need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems (my favorite part!)
- No need to install runtime dependancies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
- No cleanup, you can simply delete your repository if you don't like it

In just a couple of minutes you'll be set up with a blog like this one - [**Theme Demo**](http://jekyllnow.com)

Spend less time installing dependancies and more time making your Jekyll blog look awesome!

## Quick Start

### Step 1) Fork Jekyll Now to your User Repository

Fork this repo, then rename the repository to YourGitHubUsername.github.io. 

Your Jekyll blog will then be live at that URL: <http://YourGitHubUsername.github.io> (it's generally live immediately, but can occasionally take up to 10 minutes)

### Step 2) Customize your site

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the _config.yml file. 

You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too!

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Edit the Hello World markdown file in /_posts/ to publish your first blog post.

![First Post](/images/first-post.jpg "First Post")

To add additional posts you can hit the + icon in the /_posts/ folder to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md
