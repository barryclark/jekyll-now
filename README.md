## App

Check the template file in _posts.

## Screenshot

Every app should have at least one, high-quality screenshot ([issue #2](https://github.com/quassy/elementary-apps/issues/2)).

Guidelines: 
 * Preferably show the app at work instead of just the welcome screen. For example a Video player should actually play a video when the screenshot is made.
 * Only capture the application window and cut off the picture right at the window border (shadows will be added by CSS), unless interaction with the desktop environment is a vital part of the app (for example Indicators).
 * Make the windows as big as necessary (should still look usable and beautiful), as small as possible.
