# HPSTR Jekyll Theme

They say three times the charm, so here is another free responsive Jekyll theme for you. I've learned a ton since open sourcing [my first two themes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/), and wanted to try a few new things this time around. If you've used my previous themes most of this should be familiar territory.

**Jekyll 3 Update:** A version of HPSTR compatible with Jekyll 3 can be found in the [`jekyll3` branch](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme/tree/jekyll3). GitHub Pages is [locked at version 2.4](https://pages.github.com/versions/) so some keep that in mind if you're trying to use 3.0 features that aren't supported there yet.

## What HPSTR brings to the table:

* Modern and minimal design.
* Responsive templates for post, page, and post index `_layouts`. Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
* Gracefully degrades in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.  
* Sweet animated menu with support for drop-downs.
* Optional [Disqus](http://disqus.com) comments and social sharing links.
* [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) support for a better social sharing experience.
* Simple [custom 404 page](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/404.html) to get you started.
* Stylesheets for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/code-highlighting-post/) to make your code examples look snazzy
* [Available in Spanish](https://github.com/cruznick/hpstr-jekyll-theme/tree/es). Thanks [@cruznick](https://github.com/cruznick)!

## Getting Started

HPSTR takes advantage of Sass and data files to make customizing easier. These features require Jekyll 2.x and will not work with older versions of Jekyll.
