## My personal website

I am using the (jekyll-now)[https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now] template to build my GitHub pages.

## Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.
