# Jekyll Now

Create your Jekyll blog in minutes, without touching the command line.

I wrote a more detailed walkthrough including details of a lot of the workflow benefits and intro to Jekyll here: [Getting Started With Jekyll](#). You can use the Setup guide below to try Jekyll Now out fast. 

### Setup

##### Step 1) Fork Jekyll Now

I love starting out by forking first as you can get a feel for what Jekyll is like _extremely quickly_. You don't have to set up a local development environment, install dependancies and figure out how the Jekyll build process works to get your site up and running.

_Make to use yourgithubusername.github.io instead of souploaf.github.io!_

##### Step 2) Customize your site

You can now edit your site name, gravatar and other options using the _config.yml file.

##### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Your site is customized and looking great. Now you just have to write that epic blog post!

_You can just hit the + icon in the _posts folder to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md

## More things you can do without touching the command line

#### Publish new content

To publish new blog posts, go into the _posts folder and click the New File button. Name your post in this format: year-month-day-Title.md, save it, and you're set! 

(You can also publish new content via command line by git cloning down your repo, and pushing up your new markdown files)

#### Set up your domain name

Follow the latest [GitHub Pages Custom Domain Guide](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages) to set up your custom domain name. I've created the CNAME file already, so that you can easily edit it within the repository.
