##This is my first blog

This is a project to keep track of everything that I am learning and to keep a reminder to my future self how I managed to make that stuff work or fix that nasty bug for all my side projects

## Why Github?

Basically because it's really simple and I prefer to keep everything in just one site all the projects and the blog so it's going to be really easy

I have decided to keep the credits of this boiler plate since it is saving tons of hours:
