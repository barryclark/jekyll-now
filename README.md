## Getting Started

### Deployment

**Important:**  For security reasons, Github does not allow plugins (under `_plugins/`) when
deploying with Github Pages. This means that we have to do one of the following:

**1)** generate the site locally (more details below) and push the resulting
HTML (the contents of `_site/` or `../jasper2-pages/`) to a Github repository, that GitHub Pages
then host;

**2)** build the site with [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) (with goodies from
[jekyll-travis](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-travis)) automatically pushing the
generated HTML files to a *gh-pages* branch.
This later approach is the one I am currently using to generate the live demo.

**3)** deploy the static website with Jekyll-compatible hosters, such as https://www.netlify.com/, that allow for deployment from the Github repo and publish the website using CDNs. Netlify has a free starter offer.

For option **1)** simply clone this repository (*master branch*), and then run
`bundle exec jekyll serve` inside the directory. Upload the resulting `_site/` (or `../jasper2-pages/`)
contents to your repository (*master branch* if uploading as your personal page
(e.g. username.github.io) or *gh-pages branch* if uploading as a project page
(as for the [demo](https://github.com/jekyller/jasper2/tree/gh-pages)).

For option **2)** you will need to set up travis-ci for your personal fork. Briefly all you
need then is to change your details in *[\_config.yml](_config.yml)* so that you can push
to your github repo. You will also need to generate a secure key to add to your
*[.travis.yml](.travis.yml)* (you can find more info on how to do it in that file).
Also make sure you read the documentation from
[jekyll-travis](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-travis). This approach has clear
advantages in that you simply push your file changes to GitHub and all the HTML files
are generated for you and pushed to *gh-pages*. Also you get to know if everything is
still fine with your site builds. Don't hesitate to contact me if you still have any
issues (see below about issue tracking).

### Author Pages

In order to properly generate author pages you need to rename the field *author* in the
front matter of every post to match that of your each author's *username* as defined
in the *[\_data/authors.yml](_data/authors.yml)* file.
With the latest update, multiple author blogs are now supported out of the box.

### Compiling Styles

Following on the way Casper styles are compiled as [described here](https://github.com/tryghost/casper#development):

Jasper2 styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need Node and Gulp installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.

## Issues and Contributing

This install builds well with Ruby v2.5.1 and Jekyll v3.7.4. If you run into any problems
please log them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jekyller/jasper2/issues).

Feel free pull-request your patches and fixes.

## Thanks


Many thanks to the Ghost team for all the design work. Also many thanks to all contributors,
that help keeping the project alive and updated :smile:
