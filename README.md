A ressource for 3rd party software designed for [elementary (OS)](http://elementaryos.org). If you find an error or want to add an app, [file an issue](https://github.com/quassy/elementary-apps/issues/new). Check the [about page](http://quassy.github.io/elementary-apps/about/) for general info.

## Ask

Feel free to ask, discuss and critize in our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/quassy/elementary-apps).

### App

Check the [template file](https://github.com/quassy/elementary-apps/blob/gh-pages/_posts/1970-01-01-Template.md) in _posts. To add an app name the file accordingly and fill in as much info as you know. 

Please mind, that `web` requires a whole url including `http(s)://`, while all specific links only require the part after the domain. So `https://github.com/lorem` becomes `github: lorem`.

### Screenshot

Every app should have at least one, high-quality screenshot ([issue #2](https://github.com/quassy/elementary-apps/issues/2)).

Guidelines: 

 * Preferably show the app at work instead of just the welcome screen. For example a Video player should actually play a video when the screenshot is made.
 * Only capture the application window and cut off the picture right at the window border (shadows will be added by CSS), unless interaction with the desktop environment is a vital part of the app (for example Indicators).
 * Make the windows as big as necessary (should still look usable and beautiful), as small as possible.
