## Synopsys

Build your own incubator and start growing microbes under controlled conditions. During the class you will also get to know the fundamentals of microbiology. We’ll use our purple pigment bacteria as a standard, but you can also choose your own favourite biological agent. A crash course Arduino programming and soldering is included.

## Schedule

* Introduction & tour through the Waag Labs
* Microbiology fundamentals & Biological safety instructions
* Arduino programming & soldering
* Incubator design
* Documentating your designs
* Microorganism cultivation & enrichment practical
  * [Contamination test](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/contamination-test/)
  * [Isolation of Yoghurt bacteria](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/yoghurt-bacteria-isolation/)
  * [Isolation of Beer yeasts](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/beer-yeasts-isolation/)
  * [Isolation of Bioluminescent bacteria](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/bioluminescent-bacteria-isolation/)

## Bill of Materials

In order to take part in this class you will need the following materials:

* [Incubator materials](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/incubator-materials/)
* Microbiology practical materials

## Assignment

Set up your own documentation site on Github.
