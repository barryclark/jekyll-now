msg: "Absolutely! I have some bond funds in my traditional retirement accounts (401k and IRA). I also own a small amount of cryptocurrency (mainly bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, monero, and ripple). Currently no valuable metals, and no foreign currency (i.e. forex) outside of a few bills of foreign cash, but that's more for novelty reasons.\r\n\r\nI used to run my [Antminer s3](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-and-antminer-hash-rates/), but the electricity cost exceeded my profits (in other words, I would do better just buying the bitcoin outright).\r\n\r\nI also \"invest\" in [passive income](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/2017-end-of-year-side-income-report/) and am constantly trying to pick up new skills."
