  I haven't looked into it, but I would suspect that pageviews would increase
  the more posts are published. This would be for a number or reasons. First, at
  least for me, I tend to promote new posts the most. If I haven't published a
  post in a while, I tend not to publish. Two, having more pages means there's
  more pages to view. Lastly, people probably prefer to read newer posts.
