  That's so annoying when there's little nuances like that in the terms for loan
  accounts. While not as bad, I had a student loan account that would only allow
  me to make at most 8 payments a month. I tend to make several payments to my
  debts every month since I come across small amounts of money frequently, so it
  wasn't uncommon for me to reach that 8 payment limit.
