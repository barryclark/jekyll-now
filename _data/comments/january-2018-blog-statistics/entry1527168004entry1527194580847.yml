message: "I don't pay anything for Alexa, and I wouldn't suggest it. Just plug in any website url into it's siteinfo page and it will let you know some basic info.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if I plug in your site (https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/howtobrain.com) it shows me your global rank is 8,867,792 as of this comment. That means your site is the 8,867,792nd most visited site in their system - although it is just an estimate. Supposedly that number is updated daily, but in my experience it takes longer."
