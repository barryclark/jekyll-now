  Depending on your electrical rates, mining is hard to even break even with
  electrical costs. I think I'm breaking even at 10&cent; a kilowatt-hour. All
  the pools I've been using have "withdrawal" or "cash-out" fees which cover any
  transaction fees. Time is normally near-instant, except for bitcoin, which
  right now seems to be backlogged - but they're working on a "lightning"
  network which should speed things up.
