msg: "Hi Kim!\r\n\r\nPrint-on-demand is where the product isn't printed until a sale is made. In the case of t-shirts, I provide a design to be printed on the t-shirt, and then when the website sells a t-shirt with that design, they'll print the design on a t-shirt and ship it to the customer. I don't have to keep an inventory of any physical products at all, and the website (Redbubble, Amazon, etc) shares the profit of the sale with me."
