title: My Path
---

I've spent some time recently re-watching watching episodes of [The Lizzie Bennet Diares](http://www.pemberleydigital.com/the-lizzie-bennet-diaries/)
(via the DVDs which I now own) and [Welcome to Sanition](http://www.pemberleydigital.com/welcome-to-sanditon/). 
In the modernized versions of these classic works, one of the major themes is 
the idea of following the right path for you, whether or not that path was the one you thought 
you were on. As someone, who was on a strict path for many years and has recently jumped ship, 
this topic is very relevant to me. 

I fell head over heels in love with space during a trip to a local observatory in rural Rhode Island. 
My love for astronomy, as a field, mixed my passion for math and physics with my awe for the beauty of space. 
I happily studied astronomy for fours years of college, even landing a dream intership at NASA,
which lead to my work being selected as the Astronomy Picture of the Day.

At the completion of two years in my first graduate program, I was in a situation where I wasn't
happy with my research project, the project did not have any funding, and felt that I had been 
in the same place for too long. 
I intended to transfer to an astronomy program with funded projects closer to my interests, 
in a different part of the country. As I began the application process, I was directed 
the (then) Institute for Data Science at Columbia.
