<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized">![](https://geekyryan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image.png)</figure>My name is Ryan Nemeth and this is my personal blog. I write down my thoughts regarding Microsoft Azure, Kubernetes, cloud-native technologies, and software development. I find that documenting these things not only helps others but also helps reinforce my own knowledge as well. I may also blog about life or other random things from time to time.

This blog previously existed as a Ghost blog, and I have been working to move it here to WordPress. If you happen to notice any bugs or issues, please be patient as I work on this.

I work as a Senior DevOps Engineer/SRE for Aprimo on the Systems team.

Before joining Aprimo, I was a cloud architect for a software company specializing in HCM software.
