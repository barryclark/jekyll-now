* Abstract

The capacity for flexible sensory-action association in animals has been related to
context-dependent attractor dynamics outside the sensory cortices. Here, we report a line of
evidence that flexibly modulated attractor dynamics during task switching are already present in
the higher visual cortex in macaque monkeys. With a nonlinear decoding approach, we can extract
the particular aspect of the neural population response that reflects the task-induced emergence of
bistable attractor dynamics in a neural population, which could be obscured by standard
unsupervised dimensionality reductions such as PCA. The dynamical modulation selectively
increases the information relevant to task demands, indicating that such modulation is beneficial for
perceptual decisions. A computational model that features nonlinear recurrent interaction among
neurons with a task-dependent background input replicates the key properties observed in the
experimental data. These results suggest that the context-dependent attractor dynamics involving
the sensory cortex can underlie flexible perceptual abilities.
