[RIT Localhost](http://www.ritlocalhost.com/) is an extracurricular club founded by fellow friends and classmates Josh Vickerson and Ryan Hoffmann. The purpose of the club is to "keep students informed about trending mobile, web, and ux technologies." A few days before our first meeting of the year, I sat in on Localhost's E-Board meeting. The goal of the meeting was to plan the first few club meetings and to figure out how to increase club attendance. Every tech major at RIT has a club and a loyal following. For example, computing security students have [RC3](http://rc3.club/) and the Software Engineering students have [SSE](https://sse.se.rit.edu/).

Localhost caters more towards IT majors but isn't specific to any one major. We encourage everyone of all skill levels and majors interested in web/mobile design and development to come.

The problem we run into is the broadness of IT. RIT's IT program covers networking, database design &amp; development, medical informatics, web development, mobile app development, geospatial technology, etc. There is no singular focus &ndash; a good thing for the program, a bad thing when trying to cater to many people. We decided to informalize the club in an effort to make it more appealing and less rigid. The new format will include shorter 15-20 minute presentations followed by a "hangout" session afterwards where students can talk amongst each other, collaborate on (side) projects, or whatever else they please.

This is not enough. The club cannot exist solely as a place for presentations and downtime. We want to create awesome events that will get everyone excited to bust out their technical and design chops, we want to have something to talk about on our portfolios, we want to put Localhost on the map, and most of all, we want to have fun doing it. Last year, Localhost had a competition called Blind By Design, modeled after the awesome [Code in the Dark](http://codeinthedark.com/). Unfortunately, I missed the event for work but apparently the turnout was somewhat lackluster. The event will be planned in much greater detail for this semester.

RC3 has a few fantastic annual incident response security competitions. These are mostly modeled after [CCDC](http://www.nationalccdc.org/). Small teams of students are given identical infrastructures and are tasked with keeping up services and completing business injects while defending from red team activity. Conversely, red team's goal are to prevent all the blue teams from keeping up their services and completing injects. Sometimes their boxes are rendered useless and usually results in the more experienced red team crippling them as they struggle to survive. This competition is awesome!

While brainstorming, we thought how could we possibly incorporate some of that into a web dev based competition? For example, what if teams were given a case study and told to build the best possible product applicable? This is somewhat like blind by design but it wouldn't be limited to front end development. Additionally, we could include a penalty system where some teams lose bits of code every X amount of minutes. OR, think of the game Mario Kart. When racers in first and second place pick up a powerup it tends to be something that may or may not provide a marginal amount of assistance. Racers in the last few places pick up powerups that have devastating potential and can turn the game around very quickly when used properly.

If you couldn't tell, we had great fun brainstorming and trying to incorporate this into our competition ideas.

I'll keep posting about our ideas as the semester progresses. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me with more ideas and suggestions!
