Back in November, I created a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/puppy_snuggles) and a [Facebook page]() for a specific niche - *puppies*, or really, dogs in general. This week I created a website to go with those pages. Presenting: [the Puppy Snuggles webpage](http://www.puppy-snuggles.com/)!

There's not much there right now - just [one blog post](http://www.puppy-snuggles.com/blog/introducing-puppy-snuggles/), a [shopping section](http://www.puppy-snuggles.com/shop/), a [t-shirt section](http://www.puppy-snuggles.com/tshirts/), a [Twitter section](http://www.puppy-snuggles.com/twitter/), and a [Facebook section](http://www.puppy-snuggles.com/facebook/).

Unfortunately, I had to use "puppy-snuggles" with a dash instead of just "puppysnuggles" because the latter was already taken (it's just a [parked domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_parking), however). 

Please take a visit and let me know what you think!
