May is over. The year is almost halfway over. And it's time for yet another book reading report.

## Books I Read to My Son

I realized as I was writing this post *I've been reading books to my son for over a year now.* It's crazy how time flies. He's now a walking but not yet talking toddler. I think it's weird how I no longer have to support his head!

I first reported what books I read to him in my [April 2018 Book Reading List](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/april-2018-book-reading-list/#childrens-books). Which really was the first month I *could* read to him since he was born at the end of March 2018.

Last month I read twelve different books to my son:

* [Daddy Hugs by Karen Katz](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780689877711/30247021904)
* [Gossie by Olivia Dunrea](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780544506374)
* [Who Do You Love? A Touch and Feel Book](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781581175707/30138203699)
* [I Love My Puppy](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780545835947/30232218640)

## The Book I Read for Me

I've started a habit of finding free books to download to my Kindle. The best place I've found so far to discover free Kindle Books are on the subreddits [/r/KindleFreebies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KindleFreebies/) and [/r/FreeEBOOKS/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/). In fact, I've advertised my children's ebook [The Adventures of Princess](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M68STB4/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) the few times I was able to give it away for free.

One of the free ebooks I found via those subreddits is [Black Milk](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Milk-Darrel-William-Moore-ebook/dp/B01L8L757U/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

The first few chapters of *Black Milk* made me think it was some kind of [Frankenstein](https://www.amazon.com/Frankenstein-1818-Text-Penguin-Classics-ebook/dp/B071NCSKSP/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) ripoff. Heck, even the protagonist's name, Prometheus, seems to be taken straight from Frankenstein's subtitle *The Modern Prometheus*.

That said, once I got through the first few chapters and it no longer felt as if it were a clone of Frankenstein, it was really quite... Enthralling.

As far as the author's style, I felt he held onto the idea of *show, don't tell*, although there is a large monologue at the end that explains everything. The most amateurish aspects that I encountered were a few typos. These were typos a spell check wouldn't catch, such as writing *know* in place of *no*.

Currently, I am between books. Since I am trying to alternate back and forth between fiction and non-fiction, I need to find a non-fiction book to read. Any suggestions?
