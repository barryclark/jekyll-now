## Gps and EXIF data

To start and put _yourself into the action_ we need to talk about some basic thing in life, like... your smartphones and all those lovely pictures that you take to your face (selfies) and to your food (foodies?). _Everytime_ that you take a picture your dear phone attach some data to that picture, that data it's called **EXIF DATA** , besides the **date**, **hour**, and that kind of _logical data that it's very useful and important_, you also have a lot of technical data of your _camera_, like exposure, focal length and another funny things _about pictures_ that probably if you take a lot of selfies this is the first and last time you heard about it.

### To the POINT

Ok I will try to be **nice**, well the thing it's with my friend [Marceliwi](https://lonelycela.wordpress.com) we were talking about life, and website and a _idea_ come to our minds (that sound like some kind of zerg-hive mind thinking) and in this _idea_ at some point I endend trying to do something that before leaving Chile I have in mind, get some **Gps data** from my pictures and try to display it in a nice lovely **designed way** (some shit narrow ultra unlegible thin font with drop shadow).

### Getting Data from the picture

Lately I'm really into Jekyll and, well not pay for having a blog, frontmatter, limitations of github pages, so my first and only option was **JAVASCRIPT**, *JS* to friends.

A little google search and Badaboom!!, some good guy made a library to get the [EXIF data from pictures](https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js) and it's coming with a **PDF** that explains a lot of things about **EXIF**, that's what I call a well documented plugin.

### Welcome to trouble-town sucker

So, plugin found, time get those hands dirty, _Hi my name it's_ **NULL** _and this is my friend_ **UNDEFINED**, I grab one of the pictures from past week, and try to get the **location**, surprise, no location... and guess who get obssesed with understand what was wrong, _moi_ (that's _french_).

> how it's this possible!?!?

I said to myself in my funny voice.

Photos app, search for the info, and there was, the **bloody** map with the location of the picture, but seconds before, there was nothing in my little _Js experiment_, well maybe was the picture, so try again, and again, and again, and again, and **FUCK THIS SHIT** what's wrong with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS-VPyLaJFM) universe?!?!?!.

Back again to google to search for some answers and well, it's _kind of hard_ find the answers with the words "gps location picture photos".

I want to take this paragraph to say _thanks_ to Apple again for having such a creative name for the photos app, **photos**.

After a while and a lot of tries, in one random blog one comment brings light to my dark life...

> "The moment it is emailed or uploaded, all of that information is stripped."

Sharri

This random guy gives me the solution to my problem, the thing it's that actually for **security** reasons appears that when you upload a picture to flickr or even when you copy a picture from **Photos** to another place, the **Exif GPS Data** gets stripped from the picture, I say **appears** cuz I only experimented finding the original pictures inside the **Photos** package library.

**But you're not explaining anything you moron**

That's right my knowledge-starving friend, I'm just telling the not-code part of the problem, [If you want to understand more about EXIF and how Flickr does to get all that data click this incredible long link](http://code.flickr.net/2012/06/01/parsing-exif-client-side-using-javascript-2/) so you can learn an understand how to translate the first 128k of information in the **EXIF** and read it from _bytes_ to _human_.

And _voila_ (that's _french_) problem solved, now I have pictures with a lot of **EXIF DATA** for this little weird idea, actually I always had those pictures, but _thanks for protect my life from the evil location searchers in the universe_, and again thanks to apple for **REMOVE** the _"Show file in finder"_ from **Photos**.

### Where are my "originals"?

The easy way, look at the _gif_:

Even that the folders doesn't make so much sense, if you look at the numbers, you will realize that are created by month, then by day, and then some strange numbers with your pictures inside, so for your **EXIF DATA EXTRACTION** try to use this files, probably if you are on **Windows**, you won't have this kind of problems, and if you are in **Linux**, well probably _you will be writing a better plugin rather than reading this post_.

Forget about the hard way, why should you want to do things in the hard way if you can do it in the easy way, and that my friends, it's a **life lesson**, about doing things easy, not about the **EXIF GPS DATA** extraction.
