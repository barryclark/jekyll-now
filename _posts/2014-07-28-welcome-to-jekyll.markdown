[Jekyll][jekyll] is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. Here is a little quote from the official website:

> It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through [Markdown][markdown] (or [Textile][textile]) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages][github-pages], which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.
