February has been a frustrating month for me in the blogosphere, for reasons I cannot disclose at the moment - although I probably will be able to Friday. My stats are down, too, but not as bad as they used to be.

I was able to publish five posts this month:

* [Fixing My Wife's Timex Ironman Watch](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/fixing-my-wifes-timex-ironman-watch/)
* [January 2019 Book Reading List](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/january-2019-book-reading-list/)
* [How Marginal Tax Rates Affect Effective Rates](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/how-marginal-tax-rates-affect-effective-rates/)
* [Second Half 2018 Merch by Amazon Sales Report](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/second-half-2018-merch-by-amazon-sales-report/)
* [How Do You Report Virtual Currency Transactions to the IRS?](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/how-do-you-report-virtual-currency-transactions-to-the-irs/)

I also have some new "sections" on this site that aren't blog posts per se:

* [Blog post archive](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/archive/) which is a little different than my "[sitemap](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/sitemap/)" page in that you can link to [a specific month](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/archive/#November-2017) or a [specific year](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/archive/#year-2017).
* [Comment archive](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/comments/) with every comment on this blog on one page. The comments might not make 100% sense without context, but it's more for me to be able to find comments quickly if I so desire.
* [Featured section](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/featured/) where I attempt to archive places that backlink this site.
* [Referral links section](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/referral/) where I list referral links that might make me money if you click on them - most of them are redirects.

A few of these have existed for several months now. I'm just now remembering to mention them on one of my monthly blog stat posts.

I also now am displaying my AdSense monthly graph since they're no longer flat and boring:

## Ratios

* Earnings / 1,000 sessions = $0.48 / 1.44 = $0.33
* Earnings / 1,000 pageviews = $0.48 / 2.036 = $0.24
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $0.48 / 1.145 = $0.42
* Earnings / day = $0.48 / 31 = $0.02
* Sessions / day = 1,769 / 31 = 46.5
* Pageviews / day = 2,189 / 31= 65.7
* Impressions / day = 1,255 / 31 = 36.9
