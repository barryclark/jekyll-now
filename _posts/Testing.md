This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
 
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
 

{% highlight r %}
summary(cars)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
{% endhighlight %}
 
You can also embed plots, for example:
 
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](/figures/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)
 
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
