Not long after I joined CarFinance 247 at the start of 2018 I was going through my plans on how we build a design team from scratch with Technology Director [Jon Wilson](/authors/jonathan_wilson/), talking about what kind of people we need, what skill sets are needed, level of experience etc. We got on to ways of working and ensuring the quality of what goes out the door. Jon told me he'd been having a similar conversation with our Head of Engineering [Andy Kuszyk](/authors/andy_kuszyk/) from an engineering perspective.

I'm sure a number of you have heard of, if not come up with, design principles before. Over the years I've worked in a few medium to large companies. I am not talking IBM and I'm not talking about that oh too perfect Airbnb with their oh too perfect way of doing everything.

Design principles are great when you have a large enough number of designers you need to start sharing a preferred consistent way of designing products.

Our issue at CarFinance 247 was slightly different. We had one contract designer while we built our team, but developers were obviously still developing working independently, getting code out there - site updates, product features etc.

This got me thinking - we work in cross functional teams anyway, when the new designers start (they've started now) they'll be working side by side with developers. Rather than keeping things separate, in the spirit of collaboration let's create Design AND Build Principles. At the end of the day designers, developers, product managers have the same aim: producing the best possible products for the people that will use them.

## How we did it
We ran two quite large sessions with representatives from the whole product and tech team. Tech leads, developers, brand managers, designers, product managers etc. In the first session we explained where we wanted to get to and the problems we wanted to overcome, also looking at examples of other companies [principles](https://principles.design/examples/). We then, individually on Post-its, wrote words or suggestions for principles and stuck them on the wall and grouped them into themes.

The rest of the senior team and I crafted some initial principles wording from the themes and in the second session we all discussed and edited these to a point. We then defined the final wording. We know a few of these are well established phrases in the industry, but having them in the format below allows us to reference them in our everyday work.

> We fail fast & learn quick
> We keep it simple and iterate
> We own & deliver experiences to be proud of

We wanted to keep the principles digestible and not have lots to remember.

*These design and build principles have helped shape the way we produce great products at CarFinance 247.*

It's been amazing to see over the past months developers, product managers and data scientists quote these principles in conversation and presentations and ultimately use them to help shape the way we work.

We're currently scaling the business and these principles have definitely helped us. I'd recommend anyone spending a few sessions coming up with your own and see if they help you and your wider teams.
