Of all the cashback portals available on the Internet, Ebates is probably the most well-known. And it should be since it was one of the first, if not the first, cashback portals - founded in 1998, during [the dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble).

However, despite the lucrative appeal of cash-back, you may be wondering if Ebates is safe. First, let's recap exactly what Ebates is.

## What is Ebates?

Ebates is a cashback portal website. This means that when you shop through Ebates, you'll get a percentage of your purchase back.

## What is Ebates all about?

Ebates is all about getting you to spend money through their cashback portal. Essentially, they're all about saving you money while making a little bit of money for themselves.

## How does Ebates make money?

Ebates makes money the same way you get cashback. Every time you shop through Ebates, you're using an affiliate link. Ebates gets a percentage of the purchase price of anything you buy. They simply split that affiliate income with you.

## What is the catch with Ebates? Is Ebates Safe?

Ok, so here's the part of this blog post you're probably most interested in based on the title.

The short answer is yes, Ebates is safe.

The long answer is that just like anything else in life, Ebates isn't completely risk-free.

There are two risks involved with Ebates: they may not pay out, and thus you wasted your time, and they make accidentally disclose and information they collect on you.

The good news is that they've been paying out regularly since 1998 - over twenty years with no sign of slowing down.

Ebates information security relies on two things: what information they collect, and how they protect that information. Thankfully Ebates discloses both of these things in their [privacy policy](https://www.ebates.com/help/article/privacy-policy-115009657667).

## What Information Does Ebates Collect?

In addition to all the personal information required when you sign up (first and last name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and payment information) they collect information on what you buy and how you buy it, including:

* Browsing history
* Shopping history
* Purchase history
* Physical location
* IP address
* Device IDs
* Session IDs
* How you navigate the Ebates services

## How Does Ebates Protect Its Information?

According to [the Ebates privacy policy](https://www.ebates.com/help/article/privacy-policy-115009657667), they "take reasonable measures to protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction." While this seems like it's largely legalese (and it is) the fact they even mention this is a good sign they take information security seriously.

Furthermore, the privacy policy states one specific way any information is protected - Ebates uses a [TLS protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) on any page where personal information is transmitted.
