title: Introducing Hyde for iOS
image: /images/HydeIcon.png
---

Recently, I walked through [Amit Bijlani](http://twitter.com/paradoxed)'s fantastic Treehouse course ["Build a Game with Sprite Kit"](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-game-with-sprite-kit), and it really inspired me to dig back into iOS development. I took a basic iOS course back in school right around the time iOS 5 came out. I remember it being a pretty difficult course, as I was just starting to grasp some of the basic principles of writing code.

Now with a few more years of experience under my belt, I think I'm really excited to start digging back into iOS - especially with the advent of Swift right around the corner. I've got a few ideas for some games I want to make using Sprite Kit - ideas that will better leverage the specific content I picked up from Amit. However, this post isn't about any of those ideas. This post is about Hyde.

## What's the big idea?

Recently (like yesterday) I converted my personal website to Jekyll. I wrote [a post about why this excites me]({{ site.url }}/jekyll/) yesterday to kick off my month of blog posts. I thought it'd be cool to have an app for my iPhone or iPad that I could use to edit my blog from wherever. It'd have to be able to push changes to Github via Git, as well as provide a decent markdown editor for posts. This being a bare-minimum.

A few quick Google searches turned up nothing that really solved my particular use-case. I honestly expected at least *something* to show up! But alas, if it don't exist - build it! So along came my idea for a companion application for Jekyll - dubiously named Hyde.

## What is Hyde?

Hyde is going to be:

* A global iOS App (available on both iPad and iPhone) that...
* Allows one to post directly to their Jekyll installation 
* via Git (probably using [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/objective-git))
* it'll support Markdown for editing, with the potential for other authoring langs in the future

Thats it! Super simple, right? 

## When will Hyde be available?

Alright, so I've sold you on Hyde. Good deal. I'm not sure when its going to be available - honestly, it may never be. I have a knack for starting side-projects and never seeing them to completion. I think its a lack of accountability - which is in part why I'm writing this post.

I'm committing, right here, to begin working on Hyde. I'm going to promote this article a little bit via social media to gather some feedback and gauge interest. I'd definitely like to create something useful for the web community (and maybe even monetize it). I'd also love to work with others on this project, so I'd be open to the idea of open-sourcing the app.

If anyone is interested in helping on this project, I'd love to hear from you! Drop me a line at [jordan@betterthangreat.co](mailto:jordan@betterthangreat.co) and let me know! This is going to be my first big iOS project, so I'll definitely appreciate the help.

Also, I've got a Google form created to gather feedback and help gauge interest as well as scope out base features. If you use Jekyll at all and would like to help provide me with some details, I'd love to hear from you! The form is linked below:

[Jekyll Usage Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tHI43vE5_ITsZq8xsjJ_VS_lI2ac7RpK8sy74mQFMCc/viewform?usp=send_form)

## What Now?

I'll continue to blog about my progress as I continue to work on the project, and will definitely keep up with any questions that you may have during development. Again, I'm pretty bad at holding myself accountable, so if anyone truly wants this app - keep on me about it! I'll definitely get bored and move onto something else if there is no interest in this project (and I definitely don't want that).

Feel free to chat about the app in the comments below, and I'm looking forward to helping everyone everywhere get the most out of their Jekyll sites!
