title: Manjaro Update 2015-05-30 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **tenth** update for Manjaro 0.8.12.

We are almost there. Therefor we released [Manjaro 0.8.13-rc2](https://manjaro.github.io/Manjaro-0.8.13-rc2-released/) today. 

With this we fixed the nasty "Data corruption on software RAID 0 when discard is used"-bug for all kernels (314 - 40), updated our tool-chain (some packages need still patches to be compatible to gcc5), bumped Plasma to 5.3.1 and fixed some other packages we maintain.
As normal, this update includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (Sat May 30 14:14:33 CEST 2015).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip Müller and the Manjaro Development Team

Recent Linux kernels (3.14.42, 3.16.7.11, 3.18.13, 3.19.8 & 4.0.3), pushed to the stable branch two weeks ago, suffered from a bug that can cause data corruption on file systems mounted with the **discard** option and residing on software RAID 0 arrays. Even if **discard** is not specified, the **fstrim** command can also trigger this bug. (If you do not use software RAID 0 or the discard option, then this issue does not affect you.)

The issue has been addressed in todays update. Due to the nature of the bug, however, it is likely that data corruption has already occurred on systems running the aforementioned kernels. It is strongly advised to verify the integrity of affected file systems using fsck and/or restore their data from known good backups. As an alternative you can reinstall Manjaro using [0.8.13-rc2 install medias](https://manjaro.github.io/Manjaro-0.8.13-rc2-released/).
