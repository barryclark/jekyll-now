# A Little About me

My name is Jeremy Fink and I am proud to say that I am a Technology Management Major at Texas A&M University.
Along with my interest in Technology Management, I am currently working on a Business Minor, which originally I thought I would try to major in instead. 
It is always funny how life finds a way to change the path you think you want to take and show you a new way.

Prior to my decision to major in Technology Management, I served five years in the United States Navy as a technician on Nuclear Attack Submarines specializing in the Combat Control Weapons Systems.
I was a Fire Control Technician 2nd Class (SS) onboard the USS SANTA FE (SSN 763) stationed in Pearl Harbor, HI. 
This is what spurred my interest in Technology and has led me to where I am today.

I am currently engaged and have set a date with my fiancee for next summer after I graduate from Texas A&M University. 
We are looking to move to the Dallas/Fort Worth area to be closer to our parents and to start our own family. 
We plan on getting a Golden Retriever once we move in together.
