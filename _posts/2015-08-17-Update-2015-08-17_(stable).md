title: Manjaro Update 2015-08-17 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **ninth** update for Manjaro 0.8.13.

With this we updated most of our kernels, **glibc** to **2.22**, **firefox** to **40.0.2**, **thunderbird** to **38.2.0**, **lumina-desktop** to **0.8.6**, **mesa** to **10.6.4** (incl. some Intel fixes) and fixed pamac for AUR4. We also worked on devtools, dropbox and kde-servicemenus-rootactions. As regular, this update includes also the usual Archlinux upstream fixes (Mon Aug 17 06:57:50 CEST 2015).

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).


Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip Müller and the Manjaro Development Team
