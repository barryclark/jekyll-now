&#8230;so I went out and got myself a new one to play with:

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/north%20america%202010%20and%20beyond/Photoon2010-12-22at1629.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Squier Strat" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/north%20america%202010%20and%20beyond/Photoon2010-12-22at1629.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="288" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  I&#8217;m going to have to sell her again in 3-4 months when I go travelling again. I picked it up second hand in pretty good nick for pretty cheap, so I should be able to pretty much get my money back on it when I do have to sell it again.
