At Infinity Works, many of us use AWS routinely, but we’re less experienced with Google Cloud Platform. So I decided to find out more and signed up for a one day Google OnBoard event recently. I wasn’t surprised to see a lot of similarity between AWS and GCP. But there were a number of important differences, too — and in many ways GCP looked better. Some of the differences were small conveniences, while others were much more fundamental.
