title: Manjaro Update 2015-01-04 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our fourth update for Manjaro 0.8.11.
With this update we have **Mesa 10.4.1**, **Intel driver 2.99.917**, **bluedevil 2.1**, an **updated toolchain** and **xorg-server**.

We worked hard on Grub2 to fix an [issue with early microcode loading using os-prober](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/43254) to probe for initrd-images. For now it is supported by linux317 and linux318. Packagekit and all related packages like Apper got depreciated.

This includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (Dec 31 11:09:02 CET 2014).
Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

kind regards

the Manjaro Development Team
