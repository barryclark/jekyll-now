title: Manjaro Update 2015-09-14 (stable)
---

I'm happy to announce another review cycle for Manjaro 15.09.

It is time for our **second release candidate** of Manjaro 15.09. Only small adjustments were made. We fixed for example our 4.1 kernel series by backporting overlayfs from 4.2 and **Plasma** got updated to **5.4.1**. **Linux316** got updated to **3.16.7.17** such as **mesa** to **10.6.7** and **spl/zfs** to **0.6.5**. Small changes went into our manjaro-welcome package. Also we ship the usual Archlinux upstream fixes (Mon Sep 14 07:26:01 CEST 2015).

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip Müller and the Manjaro Development Team
