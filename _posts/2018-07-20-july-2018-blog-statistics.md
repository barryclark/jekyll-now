It's the 20th, so that means it's time for me to show off the last month's blog statistics. If you want to view the previous months' statistic reports, click on one of the following links:

I was able to publish seven blog posts in the past month. That's probably a record for me. (My poor [dog blog](https://www.puppy-snuggles.com/) hasn't had a new post since May.)

## Alexa

My Alexa rank is back under a million. The last (and only other so far) blog statistic report that had an Alexa rank of under a million was back in April.

## AdSense

* Estimated earnings &rarr; $0.82
* Impressions &rarr; 1,022
* Clicks &rarr; 0

I was wondering how my AdSense earnings have been increasing over time, so I downloaded my daily earnings into an Excel spreadsheet (actually a CSV file) and made a little graph:

![Google AdSense Cumulative Graph for July](/images/blog-stats/2018-07-adsense.png)
*Google AdSense Cumulative Graph for July*

I made my first penny on June 20, 2016. Also, the graph ends up showing that I've made $28.74, whereas my AdSense account says my (estimated) balance is only $27.93. I'm guessing the difference is due to rounding - some days I may have made half a penny, but the data downloaded shows I made a full penny.

At this rate, I won't be able to cash out (you need to make $100 before AdSense will pay) until over five years for now! Good thing I'm not depending on the money right now :)

## Ratios

* Earnings / 1,000 sessions = $0.82 / 1.262 = $0.65
* Earnings / 1,000 pageviews = $0.82 / 1.889 = $0.43
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $0.82 / 1.022 = $0.80
* Earnings / day = $ 0.82/ 30 = $0.03
* Sessions / day = 1,262 / 30 = 42.1
* Pageviews / day = 1,889 / 30= 63.0
* Impressions / day = 1,022 / 30 = 34.1
