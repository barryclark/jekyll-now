## Summary
This is my first django project for Web portfolio.

## Environment
+ `Python == 3.4.3`
+ `Django == 1.10.4`
+ `jquery == 3.1.1`
+ `font-awesome == 4.7.0`
+ `bootstrap == 3.2.0`

## Project duration
2017.1.1 ~ continue

## Main Text
I uploaded my source code in [Github](https://github.com/poqw/portfolio).
In the project, I used web hosting service by [pythonanywhere](pythonanywhere.com). 
If you create an account and launch a site as first on that site, you can get free web hosting service for 5 months.
And also, [pythonanywhere](pythonanywhere.com) provides web console. The console can save its status when you leave the site.
This is my first use of web hosting service too, but I think this hosting service is good for beginners like me.

In my Web site, you can see the timeline table about projects I've done. And the table was created by [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/). I think it is very confortable of using and applying it.
With my fisrt project in django, this is a great experiance of me.
