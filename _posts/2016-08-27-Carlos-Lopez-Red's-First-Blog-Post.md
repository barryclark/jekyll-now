Note: I do apologize if my post mirrors Rachel's.
I'm, like others from class, lost as to what the 
format for this should be.

** 1. Which research methods do you most want to learn? **
To be totally frank with you I'm not so sure I know which research methods 
actually exist.  So I guess I would like to learn the most basic method for
research.  In fact that's kind of why I took this class, in order to 
figure out how to research correctly.  I, like a large majority of people
will just research by using google and the first link that comes up(that seems credible)

** 2. What topics in digital humanities research interest you? ** 
Again, the whole subject of digital humanities is pretty damn new to me. So
in that sense, I don't really know what digital humanities is about, other
than the definition that was we went over on wednesday.

** 3. Which digital literacy especially do you most want to master? **
By this question do you mean on what type of platform do we wanna be skilled in?
Not too sure if that's what you mean (hopefully we could go over what digital
literacies are in class) but I guess I would like to master the mobile device
platform (apologizes if I didn't answer that question correctly).

Note: Once again, I'm not certain to what the format
for this blog is supposed to be, I'll fix if need be.
