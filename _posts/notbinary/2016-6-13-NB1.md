title: MLPack - Improvement of Automatic Benchmarking System - Week-4
---

Another week gone! 

This week, I worked on integrating the metrics with some other libraries too apart from mlpack. Integration for the following libraries was completely done:

* Scikit
* Weka

I also started working on the integration part for matlab. It still is in process.

Of course, it was another fun week!
 
The next week we will try to complete the integration for all libraries and take up logistic regression method of mlpack for metrics integration. Till then, we will have the metrics working with the Naive Bayes method of all libraries. 

Thank you for visiting and feel free to catch me on IRC regarding any queries about the project or even for a quick chat!
