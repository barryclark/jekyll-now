Over the next few weeks I will be reading Practical Reverse Engineering by Bruce Dang, Alexandre Gazet and Elias Bachaalany. Throughout this I will be documented any notes and tips that I have learnt and suggest to other readers and documenting the exercises for others to read. Finally I will come to a conclusion on the book for an entry level learner.
