title: AICVS 2.0 - Spark AR by Rutuja Kolhe
---

The fourth and the final session of AICVS 2.0 was conducted on 8th April 2021 on Spark AR, by Rutuja Kolhe. Rutuja is a technical analyst at CitiBank. She is a Machine Learning and Augmented Reality enthusiast.  She is the recipient of **Facebook School of Innovation on Augmented Reality Program**.  In this session, Rutuja talked about Augmented Reality,  shared basic types of realities, AR, VR, their characteristics, Snapchat filters and her experience at the Facebook School of Innovation on Augmented Reality Program.

Rutuja started by giving a basic introduction on Augmented Reality. It is the technology that expands our physical world by adding layers of digital information to the reality in forms of layers. AR has the possibility to change the way through which we interact with the world. 
The first released concept belongs to Ivan Sutherland in 1968 when he created the first HUD gear called **Sword of Damocles**. This term was first coined in the 1990s. AR now finds its applications in entertainment, medicine, education, retail, fashion, jewellery, business etc. AR is an upcoming technology and is projected to reach $72.7 billion by 2024, thus creating more opportunities for creativity. Installed user base for AR supported mobile devices is more than 1.5 Billion. 


#### <ins>What makes AR better?</ins>

It gives more natural and intuitive actions as opposed to external input devices. It has the ability to use the whole space to interact and operate the experience in. Lightweight headsets are now being introduced to allow for hands free movement. With just hand gestures, it is easy to use. It also has the ability to hide when not in use. 


Augmented and virtual reality are two completely different terms. Virtual reality is a simulated and immersive expense projected by a device into the user's sight. It can take you into a completely virtual world, such as Hogwarts! But in VR, you may lose a connection with the real world. VR requires a set of lenses inside a viewport on a hackset and a mounted device where the experience is stored or computed. Some competitors in VR include Google, Samsung, oculus, Sony PlayStation, HTC.

On the other hand Augmented reality superimposes a computer generated image on a user's physical view of the real world. Such experiences can be seen as social with several users being present in the saame space consuming the same augmented content. VR takes you to a different world while AR brings that world to you. There are two key elements required in AR. First is the camera to capture the environment around you as you move and second is the software that calculates and projects some computer generated visuals or content.

**Mixed reality** is a hybrid of VR and AR and aims to offer the best of both worlds. It is highly interactive and adds a realistic rendering of the projection to our surroundings. 

**The progression of realities:**

There are <ins>two</ins> kinds of AR experience

1. Static Augmented Reality Experiences

2. Interactive Augmented Reality Experiences

In the Static Augmented Reality Experiences the user is viewing the digital content on their smartphone and mainly interacting with it though simple physical gestures. It is termed static since it reacts to only gestures and doesn't make the user perform actions or move around in the environment. For eg filters on the phone. 
In the Interactive Augmented Reality Experiences the user is actively moving around in the real world and interacting with the digital elements placed around. These are comparatively difficult to implement.

<ins>Marker Based AR</ins> requires a special visual object and a camera to scan it, such as a printed QR code to special signs and it's like image recognition. This is very easy to implement. This can be used for drones to decide where they are going to land. 
Markerless AR are also called location based ARs and work using GPS, gyroscope, accelerometer, compass etc. This AR then determines what content you get in a certain area. <ins>Projection AR</ins> involves projecting synthetic light to physical surfaces. Superimposition AR replaces the original view with augmented reality. Object recognition plays a key role in this. Eg Ikea- you can arrange chairs in your living room.

Rutuja then talked about layers in Augmented reality. 
Scene Understanding involves detection of planes to detect surface of walls, floors etc. This is done through camera image.
Tracking  is the relationship between the real and digital world. 
Rendering is the way a digital object is represented on the device when it is placed in the real world. It involves showing accurate representations of the materials present in the object as well as representation of the same lighting conditions as the environment. 

Few challenges in AR include creating content, display issues, performance issues. But despite this, it is expected to open up a new form of computing called Spatial Computing. 

**Spark AR** is an augmented reality platform that allows you to create AR effects for mobile cameras. It is GUI friendly and can be built with or without code. Visual programming aids in adding interactivity. Customisations can be one using coding. Objects and sounds can be easily imported on this platform. SparkAR can be used for facebook and instagram while LensStudio can be used for snapchat. Spark AR also gives some templates to start with. 

**School of Innovation** is powered by Facebook with the aim of giving students an opportunity to learn and create their own experience using SparkAI. They do not require any kind of experience and teach everything from scratch. It consists of 5 steps- MCQ round, Interview Round, On-Boarding, 11 week course and a Capstone Project. Rutuja did her capstone project with Unicef. She added some effects like the <ins>Silly Clown Filter, Soar into the Sky, Hands_20, Rogue</ins>. Some course highlights include that its industry is curated, close guidance, support, industry relevance. Facebook measures the performance using the number of times the filter has been used, number of times the picture has been saved and the number of shares the filter got. 


Rutuja encourages everyone interested to create their own filters!
