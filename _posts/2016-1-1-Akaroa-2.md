## Happy New Birthday Jesus
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XYeM3uHVZnE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**YEY** the Year has just finished, and the new year was looking amazing, (at this point doesn't look so promising), in fact sounds more *missing* than *pro*, and I'm not talking about the fact that I'm trying to sleep in a couch at this moment because somebody it's throwing a party every 2 days and she it's only 16 and it's awkward enough to be with drunk ppl to add the fact that it's a **little drunk kids party**...
Ok it's true I'm not a *party guy* and I have my reason, the next post will be a *boring post about how it's life when you don't drink*, but don't talk about that and let's talk about X-mas.

When I was about to take the plane to new zealand I have this thing on mind:

- My birthday, christmas and new year will be really sad (hint: alone).

**Sadly** I have to admit that a long time ago I didn't have such a good time in christmas, I say **sadly** because I'm not with my family, I mean my **blood** family, but during this 9-ish months I just found that I have made a new family, a family based on friends, and it's funny, because it's amazing how a group of strangers can make these bonds, and fuck!, that's a problem I'm starting to attach to people... *loner detected*

*oh no emotions!*, enough of that shit, The thing it's X-mas was really funny cuz with these **friends** we made a secret santa, that ended in an amazing night really funny and with everyone drunk and with amazing funny gifts, at least **I love my gifts**, and what I gift, eternal sadness for the ones who only get some chocolates or a soap, or even worst a chocolate flavoured soap ( got one of those a couple of years ago).

### New Year

For new year's eve I was working at my new job (no way, srsly?) so I had to run to join my friends in the new years party night or whatever you call it here or in your country, the **another round about the sun** party, but was great to start the year listening to one of your *favourites* bands, cuz wasn't **qotsa** but the guys were making a good effort, after that go to sleep cuz everyone was working and the next day was a working day too so, **literally kiss kiss** 💔, goodbye.

### 2016

The new year, well **kind of sucks** at this point, like always I have no plans, not even for the end of my stay in akaroa, yes everyone it's talking about travelling, coming back home, keep travelling. Me, I'm just drawing, making a *website*, highly focused in **CBP** (wait till march and you will see), besides that I'm also trying to get a job in what I'm supposed to be good and not *"slow"*, **Design**.

Thanks **lord baby sweet jesus** for give us a reason to have a good time and for other ppl being drunk, like always.

about my plane question... I wasn't expecting to be so social and make friends, meaning, maybe **I'm starting to like these walking and inexplicable pieces of meat**.


**pd:** Did I tell about my **drawing lessons?** yes I'm trying to teach my friends how to draw, or actually not being ashamed of her/his draws, and just keep drawing, in exchange I'm getting some **french lessons**, because *sometimes* you want to speak with somebody besides a computer, and *sadly* all those languages that I know are only spoken by machines.
