If you're looking to learn about the PSC Code for Canada Fellowship team, you've come to the right place! Every month we'll be sharing updates on the project. 

**What We've Been Up To:**

 - Reading 2+ years of documents by the PPC on the current eMIB project
 - Investigating existing test systems within IT
 - We kicked off our Project Panel on November 19th
 - We proposed a new tech stack for our web application to the Architectural Review Committee (ARC) on November 28th
 - Worked closely with our friends at the Canadian Digital Service to better understand the existing best practices in the Canadian government on accessibility, digital security, and user research testing.

**What We're Currently Working On**

 - Finalizing our research plan, including: drafting our Privacy & Consent notices, meeting with ATIP, etc.
 - Completing the last of our meetings and system demos with our internal IT stakeholders
 - 50% done Sprint Ø
	 - This is a **"Discovery Sprint"** - while we aren't currently "building" anything, this sprint helps ensure we're set up for success by clearing any known obstacles, and forming a cadence for work going forward. This is also where we begin to solidify the Agile rituals (stand-ups, kanban boards, etc.) that the team will be using.

**What's Coming Up in December?**

 - Waiting for final tech stack approval (estimated December 5th)
 - Creating a resource plan for how to implement this technical stack across IT
 - Beginning our User Research
	 - Observing a test session + interviewing a TA at the PSC
	 - Sending recruitment messages to our target user groups (current and prospective managers)
 - Our next Project Panel on December 14th
 - Holidays! Fellows will be out of the office from December 24th - January 2nd 2019
