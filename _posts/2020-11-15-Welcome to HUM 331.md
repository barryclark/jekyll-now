title: Welcome to HUM 331
---

Hello, and welcome to HUM 331/HIS 336. This semester we're going to undertake a journey 
through the history of communications technologies, from ancient Sumer to the modern 
Twitterverse. In addition to this journey through the past, you'll also be learning how 
our latest communications technology--digital technology--is shaping how historians 
engage with the past. This is our course website where you'll post digital assignments 
and your final project to share with your classmates. You'll access this site via our 
class repository in GitHub, which means you'll need to register for a GitHub account 
(they're free) if you haven't already. If you don't know what a GitHub is, don't 
worry--we'll go over first steps in class. For more information on the course and to view
the syllabus, navigate to the Course Description page. Looking forward to a great semester!
