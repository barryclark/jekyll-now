You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

GitHub Flavored Markdown is supported.

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

## EasyBook Advanced Functions ##

You are using [EasyBook][github-easybook] the template from [laobubu.net](http://laobubu.net). Therefore some features are supported now:

* **Pagination** is enabled.
* **Disqus** or **多说** is ready.
* **TOC** for posts is enabled.
* **Profile** including your links and avatar on the sidebar.
* *And more...*

> **Tips:** You can disable Disqus or 多说 on posts/pages by adding `nocomments: true` into [YAML Front Matter][frontmatter].

EasyBook uses upaiyun CDN to make everyone lncluding Chinese visitors feel speedy. You can find it in `_includes/footer.html` and change it to your favorite CDN like Google CDN.
