title: Manjaro Update 2015-10-04 (testing)
---

I'm happy to announce **another review** of Manjaro 15.09 (Bellatrix)!

With this we repacked most of our packages against **python 3.5**. Please check if we have missed some. Also some of our kernels got updated: **3.18.22**, **4.1.10** and **4.2.3**. Last but not least we updated **pamac** to **2.4.2** and fixed some squashfs compression issue in our manjaro-tools for lower kernels than 4.0.

Also we ship the usual Archlinux upstream fixes (Sun Oct 4 08:25:34 CEST 2015)

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip Müller and the Manjaro Development Team
