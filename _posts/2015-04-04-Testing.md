title: The Hidden Power of Testing
author: Eddie Antonio Santos
---

Not along ago, when programming was just a hobby, I thought there was
nothing more to testing code than:

1. writing some code
2. checking that it compiles
3. running it
3. checking that it did what you expected it to do.

And if steps 2–4 failed, go back to 1 and try again.

With a little more experience in programming and having had hands on
experience working on various projects with other actual human beings,
I have a greater appreciation for testing and the role it plays in
development. For the Waterbear team, I was responsible for setting up
our unit tests and our continuous development environment. As well,
I designed acceptance tests for developing the debugging feature.

This post is for the beginner or the intermediate programmer.
Testing---whether it's unit tests or acceptance tests—is not only a way
of making sure your code works---_it's also a way to discover how to
design software._

And because I cannot imagine any topic quite as dry as "Eddie extols the
virtues of testing" I'll be filling this post up with tangentially
related animated GIFs.

So let's get started!

# But Eddie! What _is_ testing?

The word "testing" itself is pretty intuitive. You have a thing. You
check if it works. Boom. Testing! Let's go for a celebratory pint!

![Testing of the Dead](http://i.giphy.com/6MdXBLPUrL8mk.gif)

But what you're really doing is _ensuring the quality of the program_.
Testing is not only checking that the code works, but that it works
_well_, that the software behaves as expected, and---and this one takes
a while to learn---that the code is _resilient to future modifications_.
Resilient, like the extremophiles of the phylum _[tardigrada][]_, the
hearty waterbears!

![Waterbear in love... or space, I guess.](http://i.giphy.com/ltxTcWfe7CzWE.gif)

What I've come to find is that this process of defining and having
a clear vision of what it means for your code to be _right_, gives you
a clear vision of how to write your code right. It might just be that
when you take on a project, you have no where to start. The task of
programming may seem daunting, but it is more so when there's no clear
place to begin. In this case... may I suggest testing?

Despite the abundance of methods, methodology and testing fanboys (yes,
even more than myself), there is no one way to do testing The Right
Way™. The right way is the way that benefits you, the programmer. That
said, testing _does_ comes in many forms, and there a lot of buzzwords
and funny language that people speak in when talking about testing. I'm
going to try to clear up a few major concepts: unit testing and
acceptance testing.

# Unit testing!

This is probably what most people refer to when they're talking about
"the tests". It might be that you think unit testing is the only kind of
testing that is considered to be Real Testing™ (spoilers: nope). 

Unit tests are all about:

 1. breaking down your program into little tiny, self-contained pieces
    (the so called _units_).
 2. and making sure those itty-bitty pieces work well on their own.

The astute reader may notice something: this assumes that the problem
can be nicely broken down into little tiny, _self-contained_ pieces. For
a number of reasons, this is not always an easy thing to accomplish, and
the benefits of breaking down your program into testable units may not
fully justify the effort. For example, if your program needs to deal
with external systems, you have to go through the effort of emulating
the external system and all of its possible conditions, [which is not
unheard of][mocks], but certainly requires considerable effort.
Nevertheless, unit testing is must have in your testing arsenal.

[mocks]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object

## How do you do it?

Unit testing is so prevalent, most language have standard or _de facto_
ways of unit testing. For example, Java has [jUnit][], Python has the
[`unittest` module][pyunit], and for client-side JavaScript, there are
many options, including [qUnit][]. Basically, if you want a unit testing
framework look for a thing for your language that ends in
"[unit][xunit]". Of course, these aren't the only options, but without
putting much effort, you've probably got something that will easily
integrate with your system.

[jUnit]: http://junit.org/
[pyunit]: https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html
[unittest]: https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html
[qUnit]: https://qunitjs.com/
[xunit]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit

But that misses the point. The most important part of unit testing is
_identifying the units_. You gotta find the smallest pieces of whole
cohesive units of code and only then can you assert that these units
work. As long as you know the small parts work, then you'll have the
confidence to assemble them into a larger system. But, er... how do you
identify the units?

![Looking for units](http://i.giphy.com/7SUZtE9bM5xbq.gif)

Maybe the better option is figure out what what's easy and obvious to
test _before_ you write the code for it. Then, it becomes clear what you
_need_ to code, and what is a good chunk of code to call a "unit".

Take this actual example of actual Python programming that [I actually
wrote][ghdwn]. For this script, I wanted to do a syntax check on Python
files that it downloaded. So I started defining a function along with
its _[docstring][]_. Docstrings, for those uninformed, are a super nifty
language feature in Python. Wanna document a function, class, or module?
Then the first line of said function, class, or module should be
a string which will automatically become associated with the `__doc__`
special attribute of that object. This is super rad, you guys! But it
gets even radder.

{% highlight python %}
def syntax_ok(contents):
    """
    Given a source file, returns True if the file compiles.
    """
{% endhighlight %}

Okay, so we've got the purpose down. That's one step of the process of
understanding what task you have to accomplish as a programmer. But how
will you know that this works? Enter the _[doctest][]_: beginning Python
programmers are familiar with [the interactive console][pyrepl] where
they can try lines of code and see their result. The prompt for the
interactive console is three right-facing arrows: `>>> `. Say I'm
testing the completed `syntax_ok()` function. A sample session in the
interactive console may look like this:

~~~ python
>>> syntax_ok('print("Hello, World!")')
True
>>> syntax_ok('import java.util.*;')
False
>>> syntax_ok('\x89PNG\x0D\x0A\x1A\x0A\x00\x00\x00\x0D')
False
>>> syntax_ok(r"AWESOME_CHAR_ESCAPE = '\x0G'")
False
~~~

So, why not put what you _expect_ to happen on the console into your
documentation and call it test? That's exactly what a doctest is. Now we
know what we want to both in human terms, and what we want to accomplish
in computer terms---in this case, the return value of this function.
Additionally, since, we embedded the test in the documentation, we have
precise documentation for how to _use_ the function in the future. And
if it passes the tests, then we know our documentation is correct.
I told you it got even raddererer! Putting it together, it looks like
this:

[ghdwn]: https://github.com/eddieantonio/ghdwn/blob/master/ghdwn.py#L228
[pyrepl]: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/interpreter.html#interactive-mode
[doctest]: https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html

{% highlight python %}
def syntax_ok(contents):
    r"""
    Given a source file, returns True if the file compiles.

    >>> syntax_ok('print("Hello, World!")')
    True
    >>> syntax_ok('import java.util.*;')
    False
    >>> syntax_ok('\x89PNG\x0D\x0A\x1A\x0A\x00\x00\x00\x0D')
    False
    >>> syntax_ok(r"AWESOME_CHAR_ESCAPE = '\x0G'")
    False
    """
{% endhighlight %}

At this stage, I knew what I wanted, but didn't know how to accomplish
it, so I just looked up appropriate documentation. But the important
part was that _I now knew where to start_. I implemented it thusly:

{% highlight python %}
    try:
        compile(contents, '<unknown>', 'exec')
        # why does compile throw so many generic exceptions...? >.<
    except (SyntaxError, TypeError, ValueError):
        return False
    return True
{% endhighlight %}

There we go! As soon as I implemented it, I had working tests that
I could run like this[^1]:

~~~ sh
python -m doctest ghdwn.py
~~~

[^1]:

    **Bonus PROTIP**: I like to automatically run my doctests whenever
    I save my work. I use [`pytest`][pytest] with the [`xdist`][xdist]
    plugin. Install them like so:


    ~~~ sh
    pip install pytest pytest-xdist
    ~~~

    Then to start running tests continuously, I open a new terminal and type
    the following in the same directory as the file I'm working on:

    ~~~ sh
    py.test -f --doctest-mod
    ~~~

    Alternatively, to save myself a bit of typing, I put this in my
    [`.aliases` file][aliases] (if you don't know what this, you
    probably want to put this in your `~/.bash_profile`):

    ~~~ sh
    alias doctest='python -m doctest'
    ~~~

    Which allows me to run the doctests of any file by simply:

    ~~~ sh
    doctest FILE.py
    ~~~

[aliases]: https://github.com/eddieantonio/zsh-castle/blob/master/home/.aliases#L24
[pytest]: http://pytest.org/latest/
[xdist]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-xdist


As with standard counterintuitive Unix fashion, no output means that my
all of my tests passed!

But lo! As `syntax_ok()` was being called in a long-running script that
checked the syntax of many, many, _many_ Python files, an enormous flaw
soon became apparent. After a while, my script would crash with a
`MemoryError`, indicating that my program had somehow run out of memory.

![Pictured: me encountering a memory leak](http://i.giphy.com/11TXm8y1koY2n6.gif)

Evidentially, calling `compile()` cached the results of compiling
code---code that I never used, since I merely called `compile()` for its
side-effect of reporting whether a file contained syntax errors. As
a result, I had to fix this dreaded memory leak to stop randomly
crashing my long running script.

This is where having unit tests really pays off. The inevitable
occurred: _I had to modify my code_ and had to make sure that _it did
the same thing_. Luckily, I could assert that my code behaved the same
since I had basic tests in place. Now all I had to do was figure out how
to patch that memory leak. It occurred to me that I can't have a memory
leak in a process that exits immediately, so using some Unix voodoo,
I `fork`'d my process into a parent--the process expecting an
answer---and a child---the process that would compile the code, cache
the result and promptly exit, destroying along with it the cached
results of compilation. My finished product looked like this. Note the
doctest within the documentation:

{% highlight python %}
def syntax_ok(contents):
    r"""
    Given a source file, returns True if the file compiles.
    >>> syntax_ok('print("Hello, World!")')
    True
    >>> syntax_ok('import java.util.*;')
    False
    >>> syntax_ok('\x89PNG\x0D\x0A\x1A\x0A\x00\x00\x00\x0D')
    False
    >>> syntax_ok(r"AWESOME_CHAR_ESCAPE = '\x0G'")
    False
    """

    pid = os.fork()
    if pid == 0:
        # Child process. Let it crash!!!
        try:
            compile(contents, '<unknown>', 'exec')
        except:
            # Use _exit so it doesn't raise a SystemExit exception.
            os._exit(-1)
        else:
            os._exit(0)
    else:
        # Parent process.
        child_pid, status = os.waitpid(pid, 0)
        return status == 0
{% endhighlight %}

In this way, my simple unit test helped me:

 1. Figure out what task I need to accomplish. This became my "unit".
 2. Determine what would be the correct output of said unit.
 3. Document _how to use_ my function.
 4. When it came time to change my function, ensure that its behaviour
    would stay the same.

## How we use unit tests in Waterbear

In Waterbear, we use unit testing to ensure that underlying block
implementations---the [runtime functions][runtime]---return the proper
results. Since this code is the code that ultimately runs when a block
is used in a Waterbear program, we must ensure that the behaviour
remains consistent as development progresses. For this, we created
a [QUnit test suite][runtime-test-src], which can be [run in
a browser][runtime-tests], such as Chrome or Firefox. In addition to
testing in a browser, we can also run it in a _headless browser_ like
[PhantomJS][]. This allows us to run tests in the command line, and even
on a foreign server every time we update some code.

Enter _[continuous integration][ci]_. Whenever we push code to GitHub,
a worker on [TravisCI][] clones a fresh copy of the new code and runs
our unit tests. Whenever an update fails any of the tests, the team gets
a notification. This lets us know that the update is definitely not
quite ready yet, and allows us to take action into making sure the fresh
code achieves our standards before we pull it into the working copy we
share with our users.

One of my first tasks on Waterbear was setting up TravisCI for our unit
tests. Much like a Pokémon trainer in Kanto, any open source project
worth its salt is [nothing][sarcasm] without a veritable _boatload_ of
build badges. Obviously, my most important contribution to Waterbear was
to place the much coveted ![build passing][] [build badge][] on our
[README][].

It was a hard job, but I managed to pull it off.

## A word on methodologies

Some people call what I did in my Python example  _[test-driven
development (TDD)][TDD]_ or if you really want to be pedantic
_test-first development_. Either way, your code lives to serve the test.
Under this framework, _your code's only purpose is to ensure that the
tests pass_. Some people are really adamant about this process, and
assert that the only way to know your code will end up working properly
is if you write the tests first. I... remain skeptical. It's certainly
a nifty technique, and one I use often, but it's not the _only_ way to
do things. Another method is acceptance testing.

# Huzzah! Acceptance Testing!

Acceptance testing is simply defining the behaviour we expect, and under
what circumstances should we say that a thing fulfils its duty. Wait...
this is sounding familiar... didn't we _just_ talk about this? Well,
kind of. While unit testing focuses on the smaller parts, acceptance
testing is much more high level---often done by a living, breathing
human, rather than run automatically by a continuous integration robot.

Testing doesn't have to be automatic or focused on specific, small units
of code. Definitely, it's nice when we can test individual units of
code---plus, it's generally indicative of a cleaner, more modular
design---but [this doesn't necessarily say anything about the ultimate
awesomeness of the software][coverage]. Besides, sometimes it's just
straight up difficult to break the code up perfectly in this way. It
happens.

![Golly](http://i.giphy.com/104vPBH8buV9vy.gif)

[coverage]: http://www.linozemtseva.com/research/2014/icse/coverage/

Don't beat yourself up for it. There are a lot of design decisions to
make and you’re never gonna make everything perfect; a 1-1
correspondence between code unit and function is not the ultimate goal
of programming: it's making a system that _works_! ...uh. Whatever that
means.

The point of _acceptance testing_ is to define _scenarios_ that define
the _requirements_ of your code, i.e., what your code must ultimately
achieve to be considered "good". You define any conditions that must be
setup prior to the test, the tangible steps that a person has to
undertake to make the scenario happen, and the criteria for saying
"yep, this sure did work". It's like a checklist, that you check off all
of the steps, and at the end, you know that the code works.

This is a relatively new concept for me, so I don't apply any serious
formality to it. I did find myself using this in Waterbear recently to
determine whether I was writing the right thing for the Waterbear
debugger. Before I started writing any substantial amount of code for
the debugger, I had no idea where to start. I legitimately struggled for
a while with a file in my editor that just read `// debugger`. It was...
embarrassing.

But a chance encounter with my UCOSP supervisor, Eleni Stroulia,
reminded me about acceptance testing---something I had only ever
practiced once. So I got to it! I looked at [the informal list of
requirements][debugger-reqs] that we collected on our issue tracker.
Then I edited these initial feature requests into [a feature
list][debugger-feat] that was a bit more fleshed out. After this, I got
started writing the tests!

[debugger-reqs]: https://github.com/waterbearlang/waterbear/issues/989
[debugger-feat]: https://github.com/eddieantonio/waterbear-debugger-acceptance-tests#feature-list

The template I followed contained the following sections:

<dl>
<dt> Setup </dt>
<dd> How to get the system into a state necessary to begin the test. For
the Waterbear debugger, most of these came along with an example script
that would demonstrate the desired phenomenon. </dd>
<dt> Preconditions </dt>
<dd> Any special state that the system must be in prior to the test. </dd>
<dt> Test </dt>
<dd> The steps necessary that a user would do to accomplish the given
task. </dd>
<dt> Acceptance criteria </dt>
<dd> This is the checklist: the list of things that <em>should</em> happen. </dd>
</dl>

Of course, as this type of testing is usually performed by a human and
not automatically by a computer, care should be taken in sucking out any
subjectivity, vagueness, and ambiguity in the script.

Once everything has been defined, go do it! In my case, writing even
half of the tests helped me think of the tasks that I had to accomplish
and gave me a good idea of the architecture I had to build in order to
reach that goal. After writing enough code to fulfil even _one_ of these
task, I'd go test it. And out of the process, I got this illuminating
state diagram that displays all of the ways that a user can plausibly go
through execution states---it turned out to be _way_ more involved than
I expected.

![State diagrams get me excited, okay?]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/testing/states.svg)

(Apologies for the criminal unfunniness of the last still image.)

The end result should be a list that should be clear to follow in order
check that the debugger is working properly. And hey! We now have
a clear (or rather, more clear) definition of what it means when we say
"the debugger is working properly."

The process of writing the acceptance tests gave me a fresh look at the
problem I had, and allowed me to think, and visualize it in different
ways; it allowed me to _organize the complexity of the task_. And for
that reason alone, I'd recommend perhaps writing an acceptance test when
you have a large task and no idea how to tackle it.


# Conclusion

In the end, testing may seem like a mindless process---something that
[hoighty toighty software engineering types][abram] (of which
I definitely am one) are always goading other coders into doing. But the
fact is, despite the obvious motivation of "checking that it works
right", testing also yields a method for discovering how to solve
a problem. And I think that's pretty neat.
