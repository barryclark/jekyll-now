* In cloud native, open source is the default, which has helped drive adoption.

* As a result, cloud, containers and cloud native computing expertise is greatly in demand, and companies want to be seen as friendly towards open source.

* If you want to join the next stage of the journey, we’d love to see you at [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/), or in [Amsterdam in March 2020](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2020/).
