For our final project, Bear and I are continuing our research on the presidential candidates’ campaigns. After compiling a week’s data of tweets manually from 
both Hillary and Trump over the course of a single week,we've seen how their tweets are similar and different based on whether they were bashing each other or building on themselves.
However, our argument will not be comparing tweets from other elections. So we are arguing that the majority of tweets from each presidential candidate are of bashing/criticism. 
Donald Trump has more tweets bashing others, including his own party. Hillary has a lower bashing rate. We will continue to 
resolve what this all means and how it should be used. So far, our argument is that the majority of tweets are criticism. 
We also now have a list of all the tweets from Trump and Hillary and we plan to feed them through a program that's going to filter them, so therefore, it wil be easier. Instead of a paper,
we plan to make a video, which includes snipping certain clips of them and putting all of them together to conclude our project.
