This uses [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to give me a no-administration, code-friendly blog. I love the combination of Markdown + Git.

My old blog has lots of good stuff that is still worth checking out. [https://jbazuzicode.blogspot.com/](https://jbazuzicode.blogspot.com/).
