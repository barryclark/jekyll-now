Earlier this month my fiancee and a couple of her siblings & significant others went camping for three days and two nights at [Hocking Hills State Park](http://parks.ohiodnr.gov/hockinghills). During the first (and only) whole day of camping, we all went hiking.

The hike was seven miles long and took four hours. [That's about 1.75 miles per hour](https://www.google.com/search?q=7%2F4), which isn't the fastest pace, but I don't think it's that bad. It's faster than everyone who didn't go!

Check out the map and some statistics from my hiking app below:
