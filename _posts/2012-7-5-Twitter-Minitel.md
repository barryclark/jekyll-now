title: My Twitter timeline on a Minitel
---

A few months ago, I hacked a Twitter client to read my time line on an old Minitel.

This proxy do all the heavy-lifting, it connects to Twitter using Twitter4J, it get the timeline, it filters out a lot of stuff (eg. don’t try unicode a Minitel!).

Here’s the result…
