title: Manjaro Update 2015-02-20 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **second update** for Manjaro 0.8.12.

With this update we have now newer **Nvidia** drivers (**340.76**, **346.35**). This supports now GPUs GeForce 800A, GeForce 800M, GeForce GTX 970M and GeForce GTX 980M. 

Kernel-wise we have **3.10.69**, **3.14.33**, **3.16.7.6**, and **3.18.7** featuring all BFQ-Scheduler v7r7. As we removed now linux317 some installations will be blocked to dependency issues regarding proprietary drivers. Change do to a different kernel if needed and remove linux317 from your system.

Some updates to mention: **xorg-server 1.16.4**, **pulse 6.0**, **opera 27.0.1689.69**

This includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (Feb 14 14:32:06 CET 2015)
Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Manjaro Development Team
