Hi folks, welcome back to **War(un)lock blog #5**. New York City’s pandemic restrictions were largely lifted since the last blog was written, so I’ve definitely spent a lot of time out and about in the city.

It has been interesting to view New York City as it slowly recovers from a 15-month pandemic lockdown. More people are gathering to dine at street-side dining tables. Subways have resumed its 24/7 service, and alongside the trash and track construction notices inducing rage. The hospital I’m volunteering in has grown less tense as fewer patients in the wards are admitted with COVID, and visitors are allowed to visit their loved ones. I’ve been enjoying breathing the fresh air (as fresh as NYC goes) on the regular, while occasionally forgetting that my mask is on from force of habit.

Other states in the U.S. are also lifting whatever pandemic restrictions they have. Canada’s borders are still closed to visitors. India is still undergoing a collapse in its healthcare system. China is distributing the COVID vaccine en masse in fear of the virus spreading across India’s borders. Japan has been on and off in lockdown as the Olympics loom. The airport security lines are at a new level of insanity as travelers (including me!) are eager to make up time for traveling.

It is not necessarily a return to normalcy, but a new normal to appreciate things I’ve taken for granted pre-pandemic - the freedom to move around, the ability to work isolated from contagions, the relatively good health that I’m in, and more.


### What I’ve been up to

#### On routines and setbacks

Weather has fluctuated over the past few weeks in New York City, but has recently stabilized. I’ve taken advantage to explore the city as friends from out-of-town came to visit the city and the COVID-19 rates are at an all-time low. However, that has also meant that some of my plans, such as running and cooking, have been shoved to the backburner. Getting back to the routine has been more slow-going than I expected, but I’ve taken it easy to jog/walk and cook tried and true meals.

Why do I want to bring this up specifically? I try to balance how much of my slice of life I wanted to share in the blog. There are some parts that wouldn’t make sense to share without a deluge of context. There are other routine parts (laundry, cleaning, etc) that seem too mundane to share. The blog has the presentable details I want to share publicly. Behind the blog is a deluge of maintenance and mundanity that I try to make more interesting and inspirational.

The closest analogy I can put to my thoughts is similar to how an illustrator delivers pieces of art. An illustrator spends a large portion of time sketching and practicing the craft. The vast majority of those sketches are unseen to the public. The illustrator displays a few, curated, polished pieces of art as the culmination of practice. The polished pieces of art may never have been conceived without the hours and hours of unseen sketches. Conversely, trying to deliver a polished piece of art at every session is impossible to do. It not only is time-consuming, but it’s discouraging to deliver high quality consistently, restricts creativity to explore different options, and does not leave room for failure.

It’s not to say this analogy gives me a free pass to drop out of exercising or cooking altogether. It’s a combination of prioritizing these transient moments (especially peeps travelling after over a year of cabin fever) and accepting that I can’t resume my routine from zero to 100% overnight. Don’t try to achieve perfection, but always strive for perfection.

#### On doodling
On the thread of illustrating, I was in need of some storage for a collection of loose electronics. I had a spare cardboard box of the perfect size. I painted the sides of the box in an acrylic white, then drew some of my favorite media on each side with [a black felt pen](https://www.jetpens.com/Marvy-Le-Pen-Technical-Drawing-Pen-0.5-mm-Black/pd/9808).

### What I’ve learned

Summer is here! I’ve been taking the time to enjoy [the fresh air and sunlight in the mornings](https://youtu.be/QCiQho5DzfY). I’m pretty sure I’ve walked more in the past 2 months than I have in the previous 6+ months (largely due to the lockdown and the abnormally snowy NYC winter). I’ve noticed the phenomenon with my tanning skin, so I’ve had to apply a generous amount of sunscreen to avoid the burning pain of sunburn.

Of course, I thought to myself, “Why does sunscreen actually work to prevent sunburn? And why is it also a preventative measure of skin cancer?”

*What is skin?* Skin is the largest organ on our bodies. It helps protect our organs from physical damage and pathogens. It keeps our bodies cool through sweat. It even produces sweet, sweet vitamin D which helps absorb other minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. It consists of a dead layer of skin cells called the epidermis, the deeper layer with blood vessels and nerves called the dermis, and the deepest layer of insulating fat called the hypodermis.

*What are UV rays?* Ultraviolet (UV) light is a type of “electromagnetic radiation” - the same as visible light that our eyes perceive as color, radio waves that transmit music across the air, and gamma radiation that can cause cancer. A difference between these types of light are the wavelengths. Gamma rays have very short wavelengths and very high energy to penetrate skin and alter DNA, while radio waves span meters across to travel further.

UV rays fall at a smaller wavelength than visible light, with two primary types being UVA (longer) and UVB (shorter) rays. UVB rays cause sunburns and superficial damage to the epidermis, while UVA rays can cause more permanent damage (i.e. wrinkles) as it penetrates further to the dermis. (There is also UVC, which has the shortest wavelength, but is absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere.)

*How does sunburn occur?* When the skin is exposed to too much UV rays, skin cells and its RNA become damaged. The neighboring cells detect damage and initiate an inflammatory response in order for the body to start healing, but also results in redness and pain from inflammation. Some research has found that a specific protein (CXCL5) is triggered by skin damage from UV rays, and results in pain sensitivity, which may be why sunburn is so much more painful.

Sunburn is more “short-term” damage due to UV rays. Factors such as age and skin tone affect how well our skin can absorb and repair itself from UV rays. Seasons can affect how much UV rays reach the Earth from the Sun, and how much UV is reflected back (i.e. snow). Long-term, excessive exposure to UV rays can increase the risk of skin cancer due to UV rays potentially damaging skin cell DNA.

*How does sunscreen work?* Sunscreen is a goop of chemicals used to prevent excessive UV rays from hitting our skin. Sunscreen can act as a physical barrier, with inorganic chemicals literally deflecting UV rays away from the skin like how a mirror reflects light. Sunscreens may also have organic chemicals that the skin absorbs. These chemicals absorb UV radiation (as opposed to reflecting it) and convert it into heat. SPF (Sun Protection Factor) determines how effective a sunscreen can block UV rays, with recommended ratings of SPF 15 to 50.

It’s recommended to reapply sunscreen every 2 hours, since sunscreen wears off over time, and we may not apply sunscreen to all the exposed parts of our skin. Another way to protect yourself is to physically block the sun’s rays with clothing, sunglasses, and shade. And fun fact - windows block UVB rays, but not UVA rays.

As you go out to enjoy the summer outdoors, be sure to protect your skin so you don’t suffer from a bout of sunburn!

I have been occasionally eating takeout to try new tastes, support restaurants, and take a break from cooking. Since COVID-19 rates have dramatically dropped in NYC, I’ve taken advantage of going out and dining in various restaurants, if only to have a change of scenery beyond my apartment. Some restaurants are those that I’ve been meaning to visit since before the pandemic. Others were places my friends from out-of-town put on their to-do list. Others were places I’ve passed by out of happenstance, then entered out of curiosity. After a weekend of lightening my pockets of money, I would return to cooking more tested and true recipes such as [tomato and egg noodles](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/tomato-noodles-with-fried-egg/).
