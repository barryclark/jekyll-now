More than a month passed and it seemed to be a little calm around **Manjaro Linux**. Behind the curtain however we worked hard to get ready for our next **stable release** we will call **Ellada**.

**Overall changes**

Our **KDE edition** gained **Plasma 5.7**, **Framework 5.24** and **Apps 16.04**. We struggled much with **QT 5.7**, which changed the handling of **GTK theming**, however this we were able to solve more or less. Our **Manjaro Settings Manager** gained some apperance fixes for low resolutions and updated translations. Within **Pamac** we fixed some smaller issues, updated drivers, kernels and regular packages.

**Calamares**

Our graphical installer comes now in version **v2.3** which adds **End2End luks encryption**. Also following changes are to mention:

- A long standing and hard to debug issue with occasional unwanted resize operations being executed got fixed
- A partitioning module configuration option for showing partition labels in the manual partitioning interface got added
- support for NVME devices in fstab got improved
- mke2fs and e2fsck handling, which fixes a multitude of random (but not very frequent) install failures got much improved
- A type to search support in the keyboard module got implemented
- A partitioning module configuration option for selecting the default filesystem type got added
- Countless other bug fixes

As we now managed to get our **SSL certificates** and the **main homepage** is back online, we need the community to help us out with our **Beginners Guide**, as we strongly need a new section which describes how to use **Calamares** for installing **Manjaro** in different situtations as our graphical installer supports now.

Please test also this release thru and thru and give us needed feedback.

kind regards

Philip Müller and the Manjaro Development Team
