History and research methods have been changing drastically, especially since the start of the industrial revolution when data
and information became more readily avaliable. Digital humanities arose when research could be accesible through digital
screens such as desktops and telivisions, but defining digital humanities is not quite so simple.

Digital humanities encompasses such a wide variety of topics that it's almost impossible to get one set definition, however, if I
had to define it, it would be the interaction of humans with artificial intelligence and vice versa. Simply put, 
anything that involves computations and other artificial produced data could be classified as digital humanities.
Using this form of humanities also has it's very useful implications.

One such implementation of digital humanities is it's usefulness in helping researchers visual understand data.
"Tooling Up for the Digital Humanities" depicts this visualization as, "...the real power of
visualization comes in its ability to make powerful arguments, and show data in a way that raises
new questions." With this understanding of visualization, we can strongly argue that this implementation of 
digital humanities is powerful. Another use of the digital humanities is how the visualization of data
can be manipulated to achieve a highlighted purpose of the author. Often times, data is rather unorganized, and requires 
an accurate depiction and organization of it to get the facts straight. Therefore, the implications of digital humanities
are very important in defining modern research.
