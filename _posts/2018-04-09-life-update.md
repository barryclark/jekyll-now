If you're a regular reader of this blog (as if I have regular readers), you'll notice that my last post was over two weeks ago. That's because I've been dealing with a brand new family member. Yep, my wife gave birth to our first-born son.

*The Little Guy*

He's been great, and I'll probably make some posts in the future about the experience. I've been keeping a close eye on my expenses and my insurance. For instance, two weeks after the big day the hospital bill is still "pending" on the insurance website. Every claim for my son made before I submitted him to be on my insurance has been denied (including a $10,000 hospital claim!) but I called the insurance and they said they would reprocess the claim. I've yet to buy diapers for full price, using coupons. Well, except for the box I bought using a Toy's R Us gift card, but that card was about to become worthless.

I've had to temporarily put off [working on the master bathroom](http://hendrixjoseph.github.io/master-bath-remodel-demolition/). I've spent most of my time away from the baby focused on homework and projects for my master's degree. My wife and I missed one Sunday of church (Easter of all Sundays!) and one meeting of [Toastmasters](http://hendrixjoseph.github.io/toastmasters-icebreaker-speech-the-story-of-joe/). Thankfully, my job provides two weeks paid parental leave, so I have been able to focus on taking care of my wife and son.

I'm slowing getting back into the blogosphere. I began posting comments on other people's blogs maybe a week before this post. I never stopped interacting with social media, even in the hospital. I need to log back into a few of the forums I use to see what's been going on.

So that's what's been happening. As I said, expect parenting / daddy posts in the future! And my monthly book reading lists will start including children's books!
