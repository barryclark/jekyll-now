title: Java Group Project One
---

Up to this point, any programming tasks I've had to complete for college have been done on an individual basis, but as part of our Java module this semester we have to complete a series of four projects as part of a group of four.

Programming as part of a group is a lot different than solo work. Immediately I had concerns about splitting up the workload, tracking who had done what, and how to manage a codebase across multiple people and machines. Thankfully GitHub exists, and has a remarkable [student package](https://education.github.com/pack) (unlimited private repositories plus a bunch of other great offers from their partners).

The project required us to write a Java program that manipulates Strings in a number of ways (check for anagrams, palindromes, report on symbol, character and number frequency, find patterns of alternating vowels and consonants, etc) with each operation contained within it's own method. We met as a group on day one of the project, divided the various methods up amongst us, and I introduced the guys to the wonders of GitHub.

Up next, I'm going to go through the methods I worked on, but if you'd like to check out the project in it's entirety you can find it on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/jamxf/cs4092-project1).
