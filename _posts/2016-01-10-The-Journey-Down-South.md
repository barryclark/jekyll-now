After 4 months in Palo Alto for work I have compiled some of my favorite photos from my stay there. Most weekends my roommates and I would check out some of the features of the area and each week I would use one of the images from that trip as my phone wallpaper.

I've put these ones up at [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@danreynolds) and plan to add a few more once I sort through them all. Take a look and use them if you would like, I've got ones ranging from the Muir Woods to the Santa Cruz Pier, Yosemite Park, and Big Sur.

The entire trip was a blast and it's hard not to become a bit of a photographer when there's so many awesome sites to see and capture.
