## 1. Checkboxes and the DOM


---

## 2. Menus and absolute positioning

---

## Activities
1. Using media queries, build a menu that:
  - is a horizontal flexbox on desktop;
  - is replaced with a hamburger icon on mobile.
2. Add a checkbox and label to the hamburger icon.
3. Using the Stateful CSS Toggle covered in today's lesson, add a click handler to the checkbox so that the menu is displayed vertically (using either `flex-direction`, for example) when the hangurger icon is clicked.
4. Bonus: Try swapping out the hamburger icon for an "X" icon when the menu is visible.
