## ABOUT ME

My current goals are to learn as much as I can at my present job. I hope to use my skills and experience from my job at the Texas A&M Foundation to allow me to excel at my next job. 
I am interested in a career in cybersecurity as it is an exciting field with a great outlook. I partake in a wide variety of hobbies as well. 
I am an avid shooter and go to the gun range as often as I can. I also reload ammunition which I find fun and relaxing, and it also allows for less expensive ammo. In addition to these I enjoy playing racquetball.

## Todays Post
In my post I will briefly discuss some of my favorite firearms that I own. My top 3 in no specific order are:

- CZ75 BD 
- Glenfield 30A
- M1 Garand 

**CZ75 BD**

The CZ75 is a full sized 9mm made in the Czech Republic that was originally designed in 1975. Mine is a "BD" model which means it is equipped with a decoker rather than a safety. Capacity is excellent at 16+1 with 17, and 18 round magazines available.  I have put a couple thousand rounds through mine with no issues to date. This is my favorite handgun by far.


**Glenfield 30A**  

The Glenfield 30A is a budger version of the classic Marlin 336. The Glenfield is a 30-30, side ejecting lever action rifle. The magazine tube holds 6 rounds for a capacity of 6+1. This rifle is one of my favorites because lever guns are a blast to shoot. 

**M1 Garand**

The M1 Garand is an American classic. Made famous for being the issued rifle to the US GI's in WWII. The Garand is fed via 8 round en-bloc clips. When the last round is fired the clip is ejected with a very well known "ping" sound. Shooting this gun is extremely fun, and feels like shooting history.
