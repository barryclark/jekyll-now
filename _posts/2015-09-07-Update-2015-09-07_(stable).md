title: Manjaro Update 2015-09-07 (stable)
---

I'm happy to announce the **first release candidate** for Manjaro 15.09.

It is time to release another stable release. Therefor we started to work on **Manjaro 15.09**. We will use **kernel 4.1 LTS** for this release and ship Calamares as an alternative graphical installer. 

With this update we pushed out a new **Mate 1.10.2**, **Linux 3.13.11.26**, **3.18.21**, **3.19.8.6**, **4.1.6-3**, **4.2.0** and removed 4.0.9 as it was EOL. All extramodules for all kernel series got updated to the latest versions incl. **Nvidia driver 355.11**. Systemd got updated to 225, such as calligra to 2.9.7. Also we ship the usual Archlinux upstream fixes (Mon Sep 7 18:45:39 CEST 2015)

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip Müller and the Manjaro Development Team
