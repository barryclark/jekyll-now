Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #13**! It’s October - that means cooler weather (finally), [spoopy decorations](https://tenor.com/view/spoopy-spooky-halloween-gif-14092772) (is the spelling still a thing?), and [pumpkin spice on everything](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/052484). With a recently-adopted cat in the home now, I’ve spent most of my time learning about being a cat owner, and what it means to have a cat as the boss in the house.

### What I’ve been up to

Since the publishing of this blog, it will be 3 weeks since Monty lived under my household. All of his room and board are paid for - including food, water, litter, toys, and bedding. That being said, Monty prefers some bedding more than others - like an egg carton.

I’ll be hanging around locally in NYC for at least a couple of weeks as I get to know more about Monty’s personality and how my schedule fits into cat ownership. Some things I’ve learned so far:
* Monty has been my alarm clock for ~7 am much more reliably than my alarm clock. He’s learned how to respectfully tread next to me and meow once for breakfast. He’s also learned to wait until I wash up in the bathroom.
* Monty learned how to jump to my desk and get my attention... by sitting right between me and my computer. It is a good reminder for me to take a break!
* I’ve talked to Monty a LOT more than I expected. I mostly use the phrases “[boy](https://youtu.be/Pobwy_es2uc)” and “buddy”, and jokingly “boss” when referring Monty to others.
* If you haven’t seen, Monty [LOVES egg cartons for some reason](http://foodpuzzlesforcats.com/diy-egg-carton-can-food-puzzle). It took a while to figure out which toys he liked because he was slow to warm up to all other toys. He has warmed up to the laser pointer now, and also loves chasing the occasional house fly.
* Monty gets a lot of love. I was told that his previous owner gave him to foster care after moving out of New York (which is… okay why bro). Now he gets to put up with my shenanigans, but also is welcome to sit on my lap.

In the meanwhile, I’ve browsed through various pet stores around the area, and have occasionally discovered an outdoor market event, or visited another store that was on my to-do list for some time. I’m preparing Christmas gifts a bit early to compensate for overloaded postal services. I'm continuing my volunteer work and enjoying the cooler weather. Virtually, I’ve reconnected with peeps on LinkedIn, and [made some new connections along the way](https://wednesdaybagels.substack.com/)!

### What I’ve learned

After several weeks of going through basic bits of electricity (see more info on [electrostatics and charged particles](https://www.warunlock.com/11-inflight/), or [voltage, current, and resistance](https://www.warunlock.com/12-home/)), it’s finally time to talk about circuits! Electrical energy itself is not useful, but it’s instead a form of energy that can be easily transported through wires. *So how do circuits work?*

#### Simple circuits

The simplest circuit is - well - a simple circuit. It consists of a voltage source and a resistor connected by conductive wires in a closed loop.
* The voltage source produces the energy needed to generate a current. (Batteries generate electrical energy through an electrochemical reaction.)
* As a current passes through a resistor, an amount of energy is taken from the resistor and thus there is a “voltage drop”. Everything in the circuit should use up the energy before the circuit returns to the battery terminal.

Think of a circuit like a highway of cars in a loop. The cars (*electrons*) pass through a drive-through bank (*voltage source*) to pick up money (*energy*). As the cars move through the highway circuit (*current*), the cars may encounter a toll road (*resistance*). The cars will have to pay an amount of money to pass through the toll road (*voltage drop*). The cars will have to spend all the money they've received from the bank before returning to the bank. Of course, the bank only has so much money it has stored and will need to be replenished (*non-rechargeable battery*).

<div style="text-align:center"><i>A diagram of a simple circuit with the voltage shown. Note that the voltage is higher before reaching the resistor, and lower after reaching the resistor. The battery generates the energy to create the higher voltage.</i></div>

#### Slightly more complex circuits

What happens in more complex circuits, like multiple resistors in a circuit? Well, [it depends how the resistors are arranged.](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/Book%3A_University_Physics_(OpenStax)/Book%3A_University_Physics_II_-_Thermodynamics_Electricity_and_Magnetism_(OpenStax)/10%3A_Direct-Current_Circuits/10.03%3A_Resistors_in_Series_and_Parallel)

If the resistors are arranged in a series, then the current loses (via heat or some form of work) a bit of energy for every resistor it passes through. Since charges are preserved, the current’s value remains constant. Thus, resistors in series are equivalent to one powerful resistor.

*<div style="text-align:center">A diagram of a circuit with resistors in series. As the current passes through each resistor, there is a voltage drop, but the current remains constant.</div>*

If the resistors are arranged in parallel, things get interesting. Since the wires split to accommodate each resistor, like a river fork, the current splits into smaller values. The current value depends on the resistor strength; a resistor with little resistance will have a larger current flow through, while a resistor with higher resistor will have a smaller current. According to Ohm’s Law, this inverse relationship implies a constant voltage. This is because resistors in parallel [have equipotential](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/equipot.html). (This is harder to summarize in the blog post.) Because of maths, resistors in parallel are weaker in summation than any individual resistor in the group.

#### Circuit analysis

Circuits can get complicated quickly. However, all circuits have the same principles applied:
* *[Energy is conserved.](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Law_of_conservation_of_energy)* The energy can be transformed into another form, but cannot simply be created or destroyed.
* *[Charge is conserved.](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Law_of_conservation_of_charge)* Remember those charged particles from two blog posts ago? The same amount of charged particles, and thus the sum of charges, is constant. The charges may be distributed unevenly. (It's similar to the Conservation of Mass, where mass can't be created or destroyed.)
* *[Recall that Ohm’s Law is I=V/R.](https://www.fluke.com/en-us/learn/blog/electrical/what-is-ohms-law)* It is a mathematical formula that describes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance.

The conservation laws and Ohm's Law help provide rules to trace how much current and voltage is used in any given circuit component. [This is known as Kirchhoff’s Law as part of circuit analysis.](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/dccircuits/dcp_4.html) (Because it also involves solving for multiple unknown variables, I won’t go through proving that this works mathematically.) This is important to know to optimize the distribution of electrical energy in a circuit, and to prevent causing electrical fires via a short-circuit.

#### Electricity is fun!

It's been enjoyable learning about electricity this year. I've always gotten confused on the difference between voltage and current before. Yet, electricity is ubiquitous in my life, powering everything in my home. Now I have a better understanding on electricity basics, and I hoped you learned a bit more about electricity through this 3-part series!

Fun fact: [Rechargeable batteries are rechargeable](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/battery5.htm) because electric energy is used to reverse the (non-spontaneous) chemical reaction in the battery. Once the battery is placed in a circuit for discharging, the electrochemical reaction spontaneously occurs, resulting in a current in the circuit!
