Almost a year ago now I wrote a post about [my first seven months on MBA](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/my-first-seven-months-on-mba-sales-report/). Since then, I've written nothing. I was thinking about doing monthly reports, but each month quickly went by, especially with [the birth of my son](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/life-update/).

I then considered doing quarterly reports, but Q2 came and went before I could catch my breath. So instead, I'll do a first-half of 2018 report.

This means this report consists of sales from January 1, 2018, through June 30, 2018.

## Other Print-On-Demand Sites

MBA is by far my biggest money-maker. I'm on a few other POD sites, but make nowhere near the same amount. I only made $17.33 on [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/en/people/joehx), $12.00 on [TeePublic](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/teepublic/), and $6.63 on [Teespring](https://teespring.com/stores/joehxs-store).

***Curious what t-shirt designs I have for sale on MBA? I set up [a special MBA search page](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/t-shirts/) to show all of my MBA t-shirt designs. I also set up a similar page for [my PopSocket designs](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/popsockets/).***
