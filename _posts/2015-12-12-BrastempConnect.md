Brastemp Connect
====
Brastemp Connect is a system that uses non-invasively inserted sensors in the drain hose and in the power supply cord of dishwashers for the collection of water and energy consumption information. The sensors will provide RB with a profile of both the general use of the machines sold in a given region and the personnel of each customer, as well as providing the customer with a means of monitoring their water and energy consumption, through stimuli and gamification, to encourage more rational consumption of water and the purchase of other RB products.
