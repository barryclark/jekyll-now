title: Reflections of OpenRefine

---

Open Refine seems like a spreadsheet on steroids ( I thought this before I read it in the tutorial!) 
I played around with different buttons, trying to see what 'facets' do. 
Initially, I thought that the program seemed a bit old-looking and outdated. I had never heard of OpenRefine before, so I was initially 
skeptical of its use. As I was going through the tutorial, I also noticed some links not working ( programming historian link doesn't work) and 
Google Refine was damaged when I first tried to start it up ( but that was remedied after following directions in OpenRefine website.
I just find it odd how it wouldn't have been fixed this yet).
The deeper I got into the tutorial, the more I realized the power of OpenRefine. The facet system lets me parse through data quickly
and manipulate how I saw the data. I could quickly find the empty cells and the duplicates -- and these seem to be unique challenges to
historical data. For example, for scientific data, duplicate data is often a good sign because it means that the experiment is showing
consistent results that supports hypothesis. For historical data, however, duplicate records could be a mistake of some sort, so picking them
out is valuable. Things like removing blank rows and duplicates is important for accuracy in historical data. 
OpenRefine seems like a powerful tool. I think there is definitely more exploration to be done with OpenRefine besides the tutorial
and hopefully I'll get to dig deeper into the OpenRefine if I use it for something. 
I am curious, however, whether there is similar technology out there or whether something like Excel would work for this. I wish the
interface was more modern. It seems to be a running trend that these historical tools tend to not have the best UI. Aside from that,
using OpenRefine was interesting. Looking forward to using it even more when I get the chance.
