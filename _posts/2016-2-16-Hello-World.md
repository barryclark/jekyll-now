I'm excited to start blogging again, now as a Data Scientist, on this blog: AlexThompson.ai .  I've been transitioning to data science over the last 14 months, and it is time to get a bit more public about it.  I hope that writing about my projects will help me to get good feedback, and add a little motivation to be that much more consistent.  Writing about a topic has often helped me to improve my understanding of it, and I hope that will be true here as well.

Please comment away, as you see fit, when I post substantative posts in the future.

Creating this blog was super easy, thanks to GitHub Pages and Jekyll.  If you're interested in following a similar path, I followed Barry Clarks' tutorial: [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/){:target="_blank"}.
