title: MLPack - Improvement of Automatic Benchmarking System - Week-12
category: binary
---

Twelfth week! And GSoC is coming to an end and the project almost ended this week. We have crossed the 'suggested pencils down date'!  

This week I had to work on the representation of results again. There were a few errors in the code which we had to deal with. The graphs were not getting generated properly. Some blank plots were getting generated. We fixed the bugs in the code. Then Marcus suggested to use sortable tables to print the metrics table below the graphs/plots. I did some brainstorming there and finally came up with a working sortable table with a nice template! 

Next, we wanted the HTML file containing the plots and the metrics table to be responsive. I first used the bootstrap CSS to achieve responsiveness to some extent. But, the plots had to be made responsive by adding some more javascript code. Finally, I had a nice and responsive HTML report!

After that, I created a wiki page on the Github benchmarks repository deciribing in detail the improvement work done during this Summer.

For the next week, I will scrub and polish some code, wherever necessary. And that will be it! 

Thank you for visiting and feel free to catch me on IRC regarding any queries about the project or even for a quick chat!
