**PDG in Indonesia**

Indonesia’s internet economy is a rapidly developing market. It is predicted that by 2025 the Indonesian digital economy will be worth US$100 billion, or 40% of all consumer transactions in the country.

This is driven by the rise in digital native businesses and emerging tech unicorns, drawing cloud giants to increase their market footprint in Indonesia, placing the nation on the cusp of the next phase of cloud growth.

We are a pan-country operator in Indonesia with five data centers across the country both on the islands of Java and Sumatra in the major cities of Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, and Pekanbaru. The PDG Indonesia headquarter is in Jakarta. By covering various cities from West to East of Indonesia, we provide the clients with alternate data center locations to minimize business risk.

PDG is the only pan-country carrier-neutral data center industry player in Indonesia. This unique feature enables us to provide our clients with the flexibility and independence to choose their own trusted Telecommunication provider.

The 5 (five) safe and strategically located data centers in Indonesia are:
* Cibitung
* Bintaro
* Bandung
* Pekanbaru
* Surabaya

PDG is also constructing the greenfield data center in Cibitung which is set to be a two-building campus, standing in an industrial area with access to reliable electricity from two nearby power plants.
