title:  Display image, show mouse position and pixel values from web browser

If you want to view the images, and want to know the mouse location and pixel values, you may install some image viewer(s). I am at the same boat.

It turns out web browser + Javascript are good enough to do this. Here is the Javascript based image viewer:

You can save the source code locally and click the local html file to run it.
