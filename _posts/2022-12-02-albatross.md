I'm releasing my third EP, **Albatross**, as **Taylor J Hawkins**, on **December 21, 2022**. 
It will be available on Spotify, ITunes, and other digital distribution platforms. 
The material was recorded this year (2022), with [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), my current DAW, in my home studio.

The intention of this EP was to experiment with a collection of tone poems thematically tied to the sea, featuring the nylon guitar. It was also an exercise in continuing with the compositional workflow I adopted for Saturnity; I used this method to reimagine these three songs that were originally written as stripped down acoustic songs.

The microphone used for the EP was an [S-87](https://microphone-parts.com/collections/microphone-kits/products/s87-microphone-kit) that I soldered together from MicParts. 

**EP List:**  
- The Sea
- Fear on the Pier
- Albatross
