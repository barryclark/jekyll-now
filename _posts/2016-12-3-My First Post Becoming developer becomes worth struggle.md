It was scary at first. But now I’ve gotten the hang of it... Now I can look back and chuckle, remembering how the fear and confusion would settle in when I could feel the computer staring back at me with its loops and functions and Fizz and Buzz...

The classic Javascript conundrum. :-)

I have created this as a memoire for myself to look back on. To remind me of my humble beginnings. This is also for those friends of mine who are learning the path along with me… As well as for those seeking partnership in the domains of business.

> For you, I am grateful because I learn through your mistakes and successes, too.

It took me about 13 months to learn how it all works properly. Life was hectic, but it got better because I taught myself how to be a creative problem solver.

I persevered through the year of constant self-doubt, confusion, and struggle. And now that I’ve got the hang of it, I’d like to pay it forward by publishing my progress as I continue to grow. Heck, it may even help some of you experts out there in the digi-world.

It is my sincere hope to read of your accomplishments and progress as well. Social networks are a great place for developers to learn from colleages, contact clients, find solution to problems and resources, and improve their own skills.

So, please feel free to connect with me through email or social links below!

I thank you for your time and hope to hear from you soon,
