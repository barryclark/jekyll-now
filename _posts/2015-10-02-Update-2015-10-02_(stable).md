title: Manjaro Update 2015-10-02 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **first update** for Manjaro 15.09 (Bellatrix)!

With this we updated Mesa to 11 series, repacked pulseaudio 7.0, linux310 to 3.10.90, linux314 3.14.54, linux41 to 4.1.9, linux42 to 4.2.2, linux43 to rc3, updated firefox, thunderbird, added pulseaudio60 6.0 package for users having issues with the newer 7 series, Calamares is now at his second bugfix release for 1.1.4 and Octopi got updated to version 0.7.3.

Also we ship the usual Archlinux upstream fixes (Thu Oct 1 17:52:23 CEST 2015)

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip Müller and the Manjaro Development Team
