Exercise Description:
> Create a Android app and place a link on your portfolio to the app. The link for the app is handed in here. The link is a link to the APK file, and the app is the startup for login page You generate a APK file by publish for android. If you cant do that just place a link to a zipfile with the code. Also Describe in a few words what your app can do.

Exercise 1 [Android APK](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/259275/blog/Web%20Development/2nd%20Semester/AMT/Exercise%201/Exercise%201.apk) is merely a login screen imitation with nonfunctional buttons, but it does display nicely on Android 4.4.2 and IOS 8.1 (I tried the APK on my phone). The placeholders display the purpose of the textfields and the password field masks the contents nicely.

Both IOS and Android do use their own system buttons and other elements with the app as these are not specified in my code so the appearance is very similar on both platforms, but individual and close to the platform defaults.
