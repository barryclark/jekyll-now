I enrolled in Technical Writer HQ's Technical Writer Certificate Course because I wanted to gain exposure to the kinds of writing I may do as a technical writer.

As I watched the videos, I took over 80 pages of notes on the course content.

Some things I liked:
* The course covered a lot of content!
* The videos included bullet lists and visual aids, making it easier to take notes.
* My license doesn't expire, so I can refer back to the videos anytime.
* They link to other helpful resources, from tools, like Draw.io, to additional learning resources, like IdRatherBeWriting.com's free API course.
* They offer feedback on a capstone project, which can be used as a portfolio when applying to jobs.

Some things I didn't like:
* Josh's delivery was sometimes stilted and often dry: presenting is a skill.
* Few written notes or outlines accompanied the videos and the videos weren't closed captioned.

Some things I noticed:
* Some of the content would have benefited from another round of copyediting.
* Because I have a strong background teaching grammar rules and writing, I benefited more from the early content in the course ("Introduction to Technical Writing" and "Writing Great Technical Documentation") than later content ("Formatting your Technical Documentation," "Editing and Readability," and "Editing and Proofreading.") I imagine that for someone with a stronger background in tech, the opposite may be true. 

Having finished the bulk of the videos, I'm looking forward to creating my capstone project, but also a little daunted by the prospect of finding writing opportunities.

Thankfully, I came across [this Reddit Post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/gcfmuh/a_list_of_open_source_projects_with_volunteer/) which has good tips!

I'll keep you posted on what I'm working on as I find projects!
