The inaugural Cloud Native London meetup went smoothly, with myself as host and [Michael Hausenblas](https://twitter.com/mhausenblas) and [Ben Hall](https://twitter.com/Ben_Hall) speaking.

There was great positive feedback about:

* My intro on [why I founded the group and the four topics I want to hear about]({{site.baseurl}}/Cloud-Native-London-July-2017).
* "What does Cloud Native mean (to you?)" - Michael's discussion on the philosophy of Cloud Native.
* "The challenges of becoming cloud-native" - Ben's lightning demos on how to work with Kubernetes, Istio, Prometheus and more.
* The sliders, pastries and sandwiches. I enjoy interesting food, so it was never going to be just pizza!

Thanks to our sponsors, StorageOS, Sainsbury's, the CNCF and Tecknuovo, plus all the work that happened in the background to make it happen - reception, food prep and delivery, the AV crew, name tags, serving staff, cleaners.

Looking forward to [the next event in August](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London/events/240108222/)!
