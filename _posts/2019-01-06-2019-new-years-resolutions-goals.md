2018 has come and gone - and what a year it's been! Now that it's the beginning of 2019, it's time to reflect on the previous year and set out to decide what we want to accomplish this year.

I don't like confining goal-setting to one particular time of year. In the past, I wouldn't set "New Year's Resolutions" but would instead I’d set and accomplish various goals throughout the year. However, my wife enjoys setting yearly goals, and, since I have no reason not to set any at this time of year, I indulge her, and we set our resolutions together.

Each goal or resolution we set has a purpose and a method. The purpose is what I call an *abstract goal* - something I want to improve, but with no specific way of doing it. For instance, an abstract goal may be to "be healthier."

The method is what I call a *concrete goal*. This is how you will accomplish the abstract goal. For the abstract goal of "be healthier," the concrete goal might be "walk for 30  minutes three times a week."

First, let's recap [my 2018 resolutions & goals](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/2018-new-years-resolutions-goals/) and see how I did:

## Spend Less
 
We had two concrete goals for this abstract goal: eat out at most three times a month, and to cut my own hair. We actually failed on both accounts.

We forgot about the eating out limit was three times a month and fell back on our old habit of eating out once a weekend.

And, while I did end up buying [a pair of hair trimmers](https://www.amazon.com/Wahl-Color-Complete-Cutting-79300-400T/dp/B000JNQSIQ/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20), I only cut my own hair once and ended up going to the barbershop for the remainder of the year. That one self-haircut did "pay for itself," though.

## Earn More

The concrete goals for "earn more" consisted of: getting a raise at work, expanding my print-on-demand t-shirt selection, writing and publishing a book, publishing an Android app, and grow my blogs (which are this on and my [dog blog](http://www.puppy-snuggles.com/)).

I have expanded my selection of [t-shirts on Amazon](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/t-shirts/), as well as porting several designs over to my [Redbubble account](https://www.redbubble.com/people/joehx) and my [TeePublic account](https://www.teepublic.com/user/joehx). I've stopped putting effort into my [TeeSpring account](https://teespring.com/stores/joehxs-store) mainly because I receive almost no sales via that site whereas I receive regular sales on the others. That said, I will leave what shirts I have on TeeSpring.

My wife didn't publish or write a book, and I didn't publish or make an Android app. I did publish [a children's ebook called *The Adventures of Princess*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M68STB4/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) which is about my dog Princess and me meeting my wife, although I bit fictionalized.

As far as getting a raise at work, I actually got *three* raises and one promotion.

## Professional & Personal Development

The concrete goals for this abstract goal were to continue with [Toastmaster's](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/tags/#toastmaster's), graduate with my Master's, help my wife open a LinkedIn account, read more, and continue to listen to podcasts.

Of these five concrete goals, only two could are specific enough to conclude if they were satisfied or not. I did indeed graduate with my Master's (which also helped with getting those raises at work). However, we didn't open a LinkedIn account for my wife.

[In 2017 I read 5 books](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/the-5-books-i-read-in-2017/) - enough to fill one blog post. In 2018, I read three times that number of books - 15 books total if you don't want to do the math - and posted [monthly "book reading list" posts](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/tags/#books).

I mostly listen to podcasts while I'm driving. I do occasionally listen to podcasts while I'm working around the house.

## Be Healthier

In order to be healthier, I intended to take the stairs rather than the elevator at work. A few months into the year I stopped taking the stairs - I'm not entirely sure why, I was just getting lazy.

We also wanted to walk more - and we have walked some, although I don't think I would call it "more" - but it's been difficult to accomplish with an infant at home.

Finally, she did give birth to our beautiful baby son (as evidenced by the previous paragraph!)

## 2019 Goals & Resolutions

![Goals 2019](/images/goals-2019.jpg)

Now that I've recapped my 2018 goals and resolutions, it's time to figure out and plan 2019.

**I shared a few of these goals for [Wealthy Nickel's 
Money Goals roundup post](https://wealthynickel.com/money-goals/). See if you can find my contribution!**

I'm mostly going to keep the same abstract goals, except I'm going to combine "spend less" and "earn more" into one abstract goal of "improve our finances" and rename "professional & personal development" to "develop personally & professionally" to better fit the verb phrase structure of the other abstract goals.

## Improve Our Finances

With the market being as volatile as it's been, it's hard to set a goal of having *X* dollars in our accounts by the end of the year. I tried that last year, and I would've made that goal had it not been for those shaky last few months. That said, we do intend on maxing out each of our Roth IRAs ($6,000 each this year) as well as at least getting the full match on our 401(k)s.

We want to decrease our debt principal balance by at least $20,000. That's not just paying $20,000, but get the balance down by that amount. Interest payments do not count. To do this, we have to pay about $1,600 a month in principal alone. Currently, we're each planning on paying at least $400 a paycheck towards debt and plan on reevaluating our progress come February.

We also intend to do what we failed to do last year - eat out at most three times a month, instead of our regular once a week. Hopefully, the fact that we have a baby now will make this easier - except we consider ordering for delivery the same as eating out.

## Develop Personally & Professionally

I want to create and publish an Android app. I didn't do this last year, so I will accomplish this goal this year. I don't intend for the app to be anything groundbreaking - in fact, it will probably be an app that's been done a million times.

I also want to publish a variant of [the book I published last year](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M68STB4/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Last year's book was a children's book from the vantage point of my dog, Princess. This year's book will be a similar children's book, but from the vantage point of my wife's dog, Niko.

## Be Healthier

The most I've weighed in the past is 250 lbs. Recently I weighed myself and I was once again up to 250 lbs. I do not want to set a new record, so I want to lose at least 25 lbs and get down to 225 lbs. To do this, I've restarted counting my calories via [the MyFitnessPal app](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/profile/joehx84), as well as began to take the stairs at work again. I'm also eating a banana for breakfast and my afternoon snack instead of the PopTart and Granola Bar I used to.

It seems to be working - I weighed myself earlier this week and I was down to 244.4 lbs.

My wife wants to be healthier herself, as well. To do this together we intend on hiking as a family (which is me, her, our son, and our two dogs) at least once a month.

## And you?

How'd your 2018 go? Do you have any goals for 2019?
