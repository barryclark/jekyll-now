The research methods that I am interested in exploring further are firstly data visualization because I am interested in how information is presented through various mediums and how data can be made more accessible and available to more people while making it interesting enough so that people will want to understand what you are trying to convey. Another research method I am interested in is  digital publishing as our society becomes more on technology driven, it becomes second nature to exist in onlilne social spaces however the trasferring of written texts and displaying information in across various mediums is not always successful and this goes along with information design and the attemp to make the information that we put in cyber social spaces responsive and user friendly. I am interested in machine learning and how we use technology and how technology uses us.

The topics in Digital Humanities that interest me now are media studies, social computing, information design, and cultural analytic. I am really interested in the effects and the results of that digital spaces have on society. I want to learn more about how social media influences individuals/groups in daily life. I would like to study more about information design and how to create sites, visually display information and data in a way that is beneficial to users. I am interested in how biases in cyber social spaces are affecting our society and the relationships that physical spaces have with online spaces and how we react to these. Seeing as Digital Humanities is multifaceted and there is an abundance of topics to explore and to learn these all interact and affect each other. One final thing I would like to learn more about which the Craft of Research book highlights is the importance of writing well. As we become more accustumed to living in online spaces and voicing our opinions in such platforms, I feel we lose sight of how valuable communication is and the importance of communicating well beyond the limitations that these platforms might place on us with 140 characters, hashtags and the like. 

Of the Digital Literacies outlined I am most interested in  transmedia navigation, networking, and simulation. I feel like all of these will help in exploring my topics of interest mentioned above.
