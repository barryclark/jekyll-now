## First Look at the Data

We jumped right into exploring data. With Project Benson we had to use the publicly available NYC MTA turnstile data. This was an exciting first glance at what data science looks like and what data sets might and do look like.

I love NYC and have ridden the trains many times over the past ten years. The [MTA subway map](http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/subway_map.pdf) gives a good introduction as to how complex the data of a simple set of counters will be. The data is the counter read at each turnstile at each station at mostly 4 hour intervals. There are eleven features per data point. We can divide them into three main categories: location, time, count.

For our team we were interested in the Entries count. We were, fictitiously, being hired by the Manhattan School of Music to assess what are good lines and stations for dances and musicians to perform at. The dancers were interested in performing inside the trains and wanted to know which lines were the busiest and if more stations meant more traffic for a line. The musicians were looking to perform within stations and wanted to know the busiest station along with if a station had more lines going through it would it be busier.

An aside: We found an interesting, cleaner transit dataset with more features related to NYC. This is the [NYC Citi Bikes](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) data. There is interesting demographic and location based information that can be analyzed.


## Data.Is.Messy

Our team, which we branded as \@lantis, quickly uncovered a slew of messiness in the data at hand. At times it felt like a Mario video game level where we would discover secret passages, interesting details, tricks, and pitfalls.

We took the difference between each timestamp and this was the total number of Entries for that 4 hour time period. Once these differences were calculated, we noticed some negative values, and some values in the millions. We came to a consensus that we should zap the negatives to zero and zap any value that is greater than 20,000. We assumed that it takes at least a second for a person to swipe and enter through the turnstile, which calculates to roughly 14,400 max Entries, and so we rounded up to 20,000.




## Teamwork

An invaluable aspect of Project Benson was working in teams. We were four to a team and our team really worked together to clean the data, plot graphs, and come to informative conclusions. The last two days of our four days working on the project, we used a big computer monitor to display our code. This way all of us could see and more efficiently figure out how to extract the necessary data. It was also fun putting together a presentation that we all worked on!


## Some Fun Results

From our data exploration we ended up at a number of interesting conclusions about Entries. We focused on the second week of January and the second week of December. We found that the most popular lines during the week are the 1, 6, F, 7, and R. These are indeed very busy lines that traverse through many parts of NYC. The most popular lines were consistent across the different weekdays and across the two weeks we looked at.

 The most popular stations during the week were Grand Central, 34th St/Herald Square, Rockefeller Center, Penn Station, and Flushing Main stations.

It was also interesting plotting the daily traffic through each station, showing the difference between the weekend and weekday.

Something interesting popped out of the data when we looked at the weekend most popular stations. During the week in January that we looked at the third most popular station was the Q. This station was 18th in the December data. There was something very peculiar about this. With some general knowledge about NYC and googling we realized that the 2nd Avenue extension that has been in the works for decades, opened its first few stations the start of the new year. The [Second Avenue Subway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Avenue_Subway) brought a large number of riders to the Q line and our analysis of the data cleanly revealed this update to the MTA.

Here we see the difference between the second week of December on the left and the second week of January to the right. Most notably the ridership for Sunday drastically increased. The daily totals for the Q line also increased, as seen by all the weekday bars.

## Conclusion

Overall this  was a fantastic first dive into a large, interesting, dirty data set. We learned how to clean, manipulate, group, and draw conclusions from the data provided. Also spending a good chunk of time coming up with methods of plotting and graphing helped visualize our findings.

A final note for future work: A few hours before our presentation, we noticed that there are a number of stations with the same name. This happens mostly with numbered streets. Where 14th, 23rd, and so on, occur on multiple lines. What most of our datasets did was group all these stations together. This resulted in an incorrect inflation of Entry values for these stations. With more time we would be able to rename and distinguish these stations to have the desired 472 stations instead of the 372 that we had in our post-aggregated dataset.
