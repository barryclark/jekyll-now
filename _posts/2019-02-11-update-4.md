Since early November, we have been in a project phase known as Discovery. During this phase, we undertook:
-	User and domain research
-	One-on-one meetings with internal stakeholders
-	Technical research
-	Identified areas of opportunity
-	Laid groundwork for Agile workflows
This looks like a perfect blend of Technical Feasibility, while balancing Business and User Needs.

**What we’ve Been Up to: User Research**
-	We spoke to people in four categories: Current Managers, Scorers, Test Administrators, and Prospective Managers (i.e. Supervisors or Team Leaders)
-	We spoke to a total of 28 people in 15 cities in 5 provinces, and the National Capital Region
-	We conducted interviews in French and English, to reflect the reality of people managing in the federal public service 
-	We also conducted a number of field studies, where we observed: Current Managers in their work environments, as well as testing and scoring sessions

Development
-	In December, the technical stack we proposed (which included: React, Python, Django, and Nginx) was the first of its kind in 15+ years
-	Since its approval, we have successfully implemented these new technologies on our local machines, and created a skeleton application using all of these
-	Established best practices for code reviews, automated unit testing, linting, and services like Snyk, to ensure our code is consistent and secure

**What We’re Currently Working On:**
-	Continuing to work through challenges in establishing a new deployment process using Docker (a containerization software)
-	Re-visiting the research conducted by the PPC
-	Establish product look and feel

**What’s Coming Up in February?**
-	Beginning to validate existing eMIB wireframes based on our user research
-	Ongoing user research to fill in gaps
-	Prototyping product ideas
