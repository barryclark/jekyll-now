title: Manjaro Update 2015-07-06 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **third update** for Manjaro 0.8.13.

This time we released **manjaro-tools 0.9.10** with several fixes. This introduces manjaro-chroot automount feature. 

We fixed some legacy nvidia drivers for linux318 (x86_64), updated **KDE-Apps** to **15.04.3**, bumped **LibreOffice** to **4.4.4**, added some newer Gnome packages, fixed Xorg-Server, released **Cinnamon 2.6.12**, **Mate 1.10.0** and **Plasma5 5.3.2**. We have **mesa** now at **10.6.1**, patched **gcc5 5.1.0**, updated kernels and a bunch of 
rebuilds.

To round-up our update we fixed steam-manjaro client, pushed out some updates for eric, python and some needed repacks.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

As regular, this update includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (Sun Jul 5 22:00:21 CEST 2015).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update. We might push this update on Monday to our stable branch.

Kind regards,
Philip Müller and the Manjaro Development Team
