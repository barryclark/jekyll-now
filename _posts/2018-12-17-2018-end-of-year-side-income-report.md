This is my third annual *End of Year Side Income Report* which means this blog has been around for at least three years. In actuality, it's been around for four - my first post for this instance of my blog was on [September 2, 2015](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/java_se7_certificate/), although I have pulled some [old posts from my old blog](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/tags/#old-blog).

This year, I've grouped my side income (side hustle, side job, side what-have-you) into five categories: Survey & Rebate Programs, Flipping, Credit Card Rewards, Bank Accounts, Print-On-Demand Sites, and Blogging. I'm mostly just going to provide raw numbers in this report, although I will link to any blog posts where I've talked or reviewed a certain hustle.

And I'll spam my referral links as well. What's a blog without a slew of referral links?

If you want to check out my previous two *End of Year Side Income Reports*, here are the links:

* [2017 End of Year Side Income Report](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/2017-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2016 End of Year Side Income Report](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/2016-end-of-year-side-income-report/)

## Survey & Rebate Programs

* [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) &rarr; $115.27
* [Surveys on the Go](https://www.surveysonthego.com/) &rarr; $85.90
* [Receipt Hog](https://www.receipthog.com/) &rarr; $40.00
* [eBates](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/ebates/) &rarr; $12.99
* [Neilson](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en.html) &rarr; $20.00
* [Bumped](https://bumped.com/) &rarr; $14.07
* Total &rarr; $288.33

I wrote [a review of the Bumped App](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/bumped-app-review-earn-stock-instead-of-cash-back/) last month. Essentially it's a cash-back program except instead of cash you get stock in the company.

I also wrote a post in October about [whether or not eBates is safe](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/is-ebates-safe/). Honestly, I was hoping for that sweet, sweet Google juice to get me some hits hoping people would sign up using [my eBates referral link](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/ebates/).

## Flipping

Due to the time involved with having [a newborn son](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/life-update/), I've cut significantly back on this side hustle. That said, I did make $50.33 selling items on eBay.

## Credit Card Rewards

* Chase Freedom Unlimited &rarr; $440.64
* Chase Freedom &rarr; $557.68
* US Bank Cash+ &rarr; $186.31
* Capital One Quicksilver &rarr; $43.29
* Total &rarr; $1,227.92

Currently only one of the above credit cards has a referral bonus - the [Chase Freedom Unlimited](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/chase-freedom-unlimited/) - although I still have a redirect on my [referral page](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/referral/) for the [Chase Freedom "Regular"](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/chase-freedom/).

For those that are curious about the differences between the cards above, the Chase Freedom Unlimited and the Capital One Quicksilver both provide unlimited 1.5% cash back. The Chase Freedom provides 5% cash back a rotating category, with 1% back on non-category items, although the 5% cash back is limited to $75 ($1500 worth of purchases). The US Bank Cash+ is similar to the Chase Freedom with rotating 5% and 2% categories, although I'm unsure if there's a cap on it as well.

## Bank Accounts

* Quorum Interest &rarr; $0.07
* Credit Union Interest &rarr; $69.49
* Ally Interest &rarr; $197.58
* SaverLife &rarr; $60.00
* Total &rarr; $327.14

This is just savings account interest except for the "[SaverLife](https://www.saverlife.org/)" thing, which was some sort of savings promotion ran by that company (I think it's a nonprofit?) earlier this year.

## Print-On-Demand Sites

* [Merch by Amazon](http://hendrixjoseph.github.io/t-shirts/) &rarr; $2,119.11
* [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/joehx) &rarr; $60.11
* [TeePublic](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/teepublic/) &rarr; $30.00
* [Teespring](https://teespring.com/stores/joehxs-store) &rarr; $10.63
* Total &rarr; $2,219.85

## Blogging

* Amazon Associates &rarr; $53.15
* Square Cash Referrals &rarr; $30.00
* Total &rarr; $83.15

I assume my [Square Cash Referrals](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/square-cash/) came from my [Square Cash Review](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/square-cash-review/), although I could be wrong.

Amazon Associates is just when someone buys a product from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) after clicking an Amazon link from this website.
