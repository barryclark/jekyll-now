title:  My Answer To Common Interview Questions
tags: personal
---
My answers to interview questions have varied between meetings. As I advance in my career, I see my interests evolve. Fortunately, my principles remain the same. Mindfulness. Eagerness to learn and Comfort with failure are just a few. Here's how I answer top interview questions.

## What can you tell me about yourself?
I'm curious, approaching every new endeavor with childlike curiosity. I am not afraid to ask questions. I prefer being the 'dumb' one if it means I'm one step closer to understanding the topic further.

## Can you list your strengths?
My greatest strengths are my curiosity, resourcefulness, and capacity to adapt.

## What weaknesses do you have?
I'm incredibly critical of myself. I've been stumped on a problem due to fright of failing or being wrong. I now mitigate fright by taking on many small risks. I find being comfortable with failure has helped curb the critic inside.

## Why should I consider hiring you?
Business priorities change. From the time of my interview to the time I'm hired, the business needs may be different. I'm comfortable with change. Adaptability is what makes a great hire.

## Where do you see yourself five years from now?
Five years from now, I see myself as mentoring junior hires with the best practices I learned. I also see myself continuing to learn, especially from the junior hires who may help me see problems and solutions from a different perspective.

## Why do you want to work here?
Most likely, I like the mission statement. The job description is appealing. Or my commute is less than 10 minutes. Not to mention, you pay well.

## What is your salary expectation?
More than I made previously with some flexibility, given how exciting the opportunity may be.

## What motivates you?
New business challenges keep me motivated. There is no greater satisfaction than seeing a project or goal being fully accomplished. If I can continue to apply my problem-solving abilities and critical thinking all the better.

## What makes you a good team player?
I genuinely care about people and will go to great lengths to make sure everyone feels like they're a part of a team. I empathize with any team member that may feel left out. They shouldn't feel that way.
