title: Keeping up to date as a software developer
---
Introducing.. well me
---------------------

I am a professional software developer (or at least an employed one ;) ) for about 8 years, and programming in some way for about 17 years. Actually my first programing language, surprisingly or not, was in my mother tongue (Hebrew) that was based on the "turtle" language in a afternoon course in my junior high. And after the point, I was hooked and still going strong.

So why am I writing this blog, you maybe wondering, it's because one of my most important ideals of sharing knowledge, which ties in my mind very tightly to this post subject. Which I have started when I have been asked a couple of times in the past few weeks on "how I keep up to date as a developer", that had lead me to reflect on my way with this post. And I am also looking forward for the possible related conversations to come and to learn how others do it.

Why
---

During my first programming job, I had a "very deep" thought that "I must stay relevant, up to date" but I did not know how to do that. As I gained more and more experience, I have learned the importance of gaining wide knowledge which contributes a couple of very good and important benefits:
Wide knowledge can introduce concepts, ideas and even tools for envisioning new features or improving the current ones. Which could extend the tool belt with new knowledge about architectural concepts, tools and standard practices. Or even spark new interest personal or even a whole new career wise.

How
---

So how to tackle this important task: in my mind it's an ongoing way of life, like a doctor that reads a medical journals, goes to medical conventions, checks out his colleagues' work and more (a lot more) so we need to always practice it and it will become or inspire a very interesting part of your work. After a bit of philosophy let's get down to the specifics:

* **General curiosity** - My grandfather always said "always learn when someone is helping you". Always ask why, do not agree to let knowledge pass you by. Explore always when given a task to do, look to your right and left for different solutions possibilities. Always pay attention, listen, to your colleagues work/"shop" discussions, and always learn from reviews given to you and you give to them.
* **Share knowledge, *always and with everyone*** - If in the course of a discussion, code review, by giving a talk or any other way.

  You may surprise yourself that you're wrong (What!? NO..) or out of date, use the time that other had spent in exploring those topics. And even if you are correct that will give some practice in convoying ideas and maybe understanding those subjects more.
* **GitHub explore** - I very much like to check on weekly basis (or when I am bored) the [trending projects](https://github.com/trending) in particular the languages I use currently or interested in, and I look for cool new projects that are trending in the open source community (the wisdom of the masses).

    I think this is a very fun and easy way of finding currently relevant projects and maybe same inspiration for future projects, if for work or fun purposes.
* **Articles feeds** - For the ones that are not familiar this medium, it's usually an email subscription newsletter with interesting articles.

    This is a problematic resource because they could "bombarded" you with emails, and you could ignore them easily. So in my mind, when you subscribe to a feed if it possible define as narrow as possible scope of interest.

    Also for managing those subscriptions I suggest, if you did not read them for let say three months you should unsubscribe, you will do a favor to you by not dealing with this and a favor for the feed's managers that pay money for sending you the email with expectation for revenue from ads. And after you catch up with these feeds and like them, resubscribe to the feed and repeat. I also suggest, if you use a Gmail account, please use the ability of [adding a context](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html) to your received email by subscribing to a feed with '<user-name>+<topic>@gmail.com' so you could combine feeds with the same area.

    I also include to this medium Google Now recommendations because it's similar in nature, but this is very easy to use and consume with not a bad rate of interesting links (from articles to even relevant github repositories) so I really recommend it (the "GitHub experience").
* **YouTube video**s - There are a lot of conventions around the world on a very wide range of topics (from language specific, different fields, frameworks and etc) which make their lectures extremely accessible through filming and posting them to a YouTube channel.

    This allows on your own time to catchup on probably any topics that you’re interested, this due to this wide abundance. Another great way of finding interesting videos is via following the channel of the companies you wonder how they work (or interested working in), they are actually a collection of videos for conventions the company's people had given.
* **Podcasts** - Like YouTube videos there are a lot of podcasts from around the world on a very wide range of topics, and this is a great medium because you consume it while on the go with just a pair with headphones.

    I recommend subscribing to a lot of podcasts, because probably you will not like all of their content and it's nice to always have interesting content to listen to and also it will give you the same value as GitHub trending (by finding out an interesting topics to explore without "spending" the time in listening to a not interesting episode).
* **Meetups** - Because of limited free time or convince, I only go to some meetups which are a great source of information and creating connections with your colleagues, which is also very much in line of my ideal of sharing the knowledge.

    Besides actually going to meetups there are two other ways of enjoying that information, one is via meetups that record their sessions and publish on a YouTube channel (which of course is great!!). And the second one is like the "GitHub trending experience" (trademark pending ;) ), by subscribing to a lot of meetups and enjoy the lecture topics (which represents the trending topics), but **go to meetups** and support the organizers that do this on their on time and without no payment (THANK YOU!!).
* **Online courses** - Of course they are a great resource of learning, but I think this is out of scope of just "getting up to date" because the main goal is to easily (somewhat easily of course) widen your view and knowledge and not necessarily deep-in. But this is a great next step when you encountered something that you found interesting.

Day 0 - So what to do now!?
---------------------------

Firstly *congrats* on starting this journey, I am sure you will enjoy it and benefit from it.
"OK so really what do I do now.." so like I mentioned in the passing, a good place to start widening your knowledge is what's relevant to you today: current programing languages you use, specific areas in computer science like: ML, embedded programing and etc. Something that will benefit you tomorrow, so it will give you the push/kick/drive (I can go on :) ) to start.

In regards to which medium to start with, you should chose the one you feel easiest for to stick with it. Like checking out the [GitHub trending page](https://github.com/trending) or going to meetup because you can drag someone with you (hopefully not by force).
After the first taste of cool new information, the hunger will start to set in for more sources because you probably will be more curious and want to widen your perceptive and knowledge.

I recommend if you learned something interesting, that drove you to read more then source about it **SHARE** it with you colleagues (work, friends and/or community). You will probably gain a lot from the **discussions** that will arise, that will help you in getting to know about other related issues or even to find out that you did not quiet understood what you learned. Use the research that other people worked hard to achieve and always give back.

Conclusions
-----------

Although this seems like a huge and cumbersome task with a little (or very much) philosophical side (coming from my view of this), but in a practical sense, these options are a part of the possible tool belt of every programmer and you should find out what works for you. Because if this won't be easy and hopefully fun for you it will not happen, so try (really try!), and see what works for you there is no silver bullet.
