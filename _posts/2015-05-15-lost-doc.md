What's currently in the MTA's Lost and Found underneath Penn Station? So many things. Like, nearly two hundred thousand things. We use the Metropolitan Transit Authority's Developer Data API to get up-to-the-hour information about the contents of the Lost and Found, sorted by type.

I recently discovered the [MTA's collection of excellent APIs](http://web.mta.info/developers) containing information on a number of things, including an up-to-the-minute service status page, a listing of all elevators and escalators in the entire NY public transit system (and their operational status), MTA Bus Time, MTA Subway Time, a comprehensive GTFS with schedule data, and many other exceptional resources. The one that caught my eye was their Lost and Found API, listing the complete contents of their underground, windowless vault of miscellanea. We collect the data from their API, parse the XML in Javascript, and print it in a human-readable format.
