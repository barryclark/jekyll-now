title: The. Best. Programming. Language.
---

I've found the best programming language!

Just kidding...

I researched a lot of programming languages in my journey to the western software engineer:

* Ruby
* Python
* Scala
* Go
* Lisp / Arc / Clojure
* ECMAScript / Javascript / JScript / CoffeeScript / TypeScript
* Swift

My thinking was that it would save me a lot of time going forward. I could pick **the best** language and learn from there for immediate application in the real world. 

Except that's not the case. 

After a while of searching I realized languages don't matter too much. Yes there are differences between them, but ultimately you need to learn the fundamental concepts and from there you just need to figure out the specific syntax peculiarities. 

Once you've learned one language, learning a new one is much easier and those skills compound!
