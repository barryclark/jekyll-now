For my final project, I plan to make an infographic representing the changes in diversity over various seasons of Saturday Night Live. I chose this because I want to study if popular classic television shows are getting more or less diverse, this is important, because popular television has a strong influence on culture as a whole. 

This idea is in it’s beginning stages, I have also been considering studying another long-running show like Friends instead, or doing some sort of augmented gender timer for race instead on a classic movie like Star Wars.

Research Question: Diversity in popular tv show (SNL), How has the cast of SNL changed culturally over the years, representation and diversity is important, especially inpopulat classics like SNL.
Plan: Survey the cast of SNL from the time that it began to today and study trends in percentage of multicultural cast, to white cast.
Kind of Artifact: infographic
