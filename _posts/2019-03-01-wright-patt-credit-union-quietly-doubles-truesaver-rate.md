Wright-Patt Credit Union (WPCU) members like me were pleasantly surprised to see that the amount they receive in their TrueSaver account had nearly doubled.

When I logged into my WPCU account today, I noticed that I received $2.24 in interest (Wright-Patt calls it "dividends") instead of my normal $1.26:

The TrueSaver accounts used to have a rate of 3%. Now they have a rate of 6%.

The other conditions for a TrueSaver account remain the same:

* The special rate only applies to balances up to $500; a lower rate (0.15%) is applied to higher balances.
* The member must also have an active checking account with at least four eligible transactions a month. Eligible transactions include:
  * Bill bay transactions
  * ACH deposits and withdrawals
  * Debit card transactions
  * Point of sale transactions
  * Cleared drafts
* There must be either regular direct deposits (at least once every 45 days) or be set up to receive eStatements

With online banks now having rates of high as 2.5% and climbing, I was beginning to worry that they would soon surpass WPCU's TrueSaver rate. Now I can offset those worries.
