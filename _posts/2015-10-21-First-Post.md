title: Transitioning YasharBahman.com and TouchMe to GitHub
---

As you may or may not have known, both [YasharBahman.com](http://www.yasharbahman.com) and tbe [TouchMe Engine](http://touchme.yasharbahman.com/GetTouchMeEngine.html) have been hosted on FatCow. This is because I'm a complete noob and I had no idea GitHub allowed users to host websites. 

Let me be the first to say. I _hate_ FatCow. God. It's so slow. TouchMe users, I'm truly sorry I made you endure this. 

Soon, I will be transitioning everything to this GitHub page which is lighting fast and super awesome.  Stay tuned!
