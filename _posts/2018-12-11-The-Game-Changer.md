title: The Game Changer
---

Hello Internet World !
Longest time to make this post!

There comes a time inn every individual's life when he/she comes across an event which totally changes
his/her perspective.Problem solving varies from person to person because each person has a unqiue way of 
thinking, a unique way to approaching a problem. I truly believe that there infinite number of ways to solve
a given problem.
In this post, I want to mention my game changing  moment and how my way of approaching towards a given problem evovled.

In the March of 2018, I participated in [HACKATHONCLT MMXVIII](http://tresata.com/tresata-announces-hackathonclt-mmxviii/) conducted in Charlotte, North Carolina. You can read more about it on th hyperlink and also check out my project submission and description <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/project-1/">here</a>.

Usually my approach towards solving a problem basically was to understand the question and find a possible answer.
But after coming in the top 3 positions for the Hack Category, I realized how much I have evolved. I understood that the way I learn needs to evolve as well. Everyone has their own way of learning, I just want to share my way.

### Steps: Learning Python in 21 days
1. I had a lot of struggle to begin with the process. Push yourself and just start with it.
2. Start with basics and even if you feel just bear with it. I promise you will definitely not regret it.
3. Keep targets on a day-to-day basis and try to accomplish them.
4. Materials used for learning always play a key role. I personally learnt the basics from codecademy and tried to solve the problems on hackerrank.Refer the following links:
*  [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)
*  [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) 
5. Stay strong and be happy. Don't stress of not getting the answer on the first go.
Just remember, "Rome wasn't built in a day.!"

Let me know in the comments below your way of learning and if my post helped you in any way!

Thanks!!
