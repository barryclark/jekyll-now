I maintain a list of interesting AI/ML blogs, and scientist and researcher profiles so that I can keep in touch with research trends in AIML and keep myself motivated and informative for research.    
* [Charles Martin, Ph.D](https://calculatedcontent.com/): Applied AI and ML       
* [Shakir](http://blog.shakirm.com/): Statistical Machine Learning and AI  
* [Prof. Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/stat_bio.html) Famous for Bayesian networks and Causality for AI.    
* [Dustin Tran](http://dustintran.com/): a Ph.D student in Computer Science at Columbia who works in Bayesian statisics.   
* [Yarin Gal](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/index.html): He works in Bayesian Deep Learning and  approximate inference which are closely related to my research.   
* [Diederik P. Kingma](http://dpkingma.com/): He works in variational methods and Bayesian statistics for Deep Learning and have published various papers to NIPS. ICML and ICLR   
* [Non-convex Optimization](http://www.offconvex.org/about/), a very elegent blog about Optimization   
* [Andrej Karpathy's](http://karpathy.github.io/), a Ph.D student @ Stanford working in Computer Vision, RNN  
* [Patrick Mineault's](https://xcorr.net/), Ph.D., a data scientist at Google    
* [ Jeremy's](https://jeremykun.com/), A mathematics Ph.D student @ Illinois, a very elegent blog with proofs about various topics including Machine Learning.
