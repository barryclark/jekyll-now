title: Problem Solving!
---


**How good it would be if:**



*   You are done with 100% Computer Science fundamental subjects.
*   You have solved 200 questions to improve your problem solving skills.
*   You have built 2 projects to write on your resume.
*   You have confidence to speak up how productively you use your time to improve niche skills( by not copying codes!!)

This program of 70 days needs less effort and consistency to make you confident. We believe and expect you to be honest in your hardwork and leave the planning part for us.

Anyone can do it if (s)he puts in time to be better. We believe in small wins everyday. You won't be a success overnight because they have banned TikTok :P :)

**Goals:**



*   Resume enhancement and to increase the weightage of it by doing two quality projects by own hand from scratch and with complete domain knowledge.
*   Good understanding of CS fundamentals after lively discussion everyday.
*   Being expressive to walk through your code and thoughts in front of people.
*   Improve problem solving skills to solve good level questions
*   To be a different person with consistent learning habits.

**Achievements:**

After a week:



*   You will have good in depth knowledge of 20% of OS and 20% of Algorithm syllabus which we have designed for you
*   You would have solved around 14 to 20 questions in a consistent manner by deploying codes on open source.
*   A grip on one programming language to write codes
*   Most importantly- A habit to complete small daily tasks
*   How to initiate a project and do its documentation

After a month



*   Nearly 40% of Algorithm and OS theoretical part without complications
*   You would have solved around 60 to 80 question sand proficient for codechef long challenges
*   You would have learned the intricacies of GIT, setting up the environment for projects and fun shortcuts like STL.
*   Completion of one project by the end of 4 weeks

After 70 days



*   100% syllabus of OS and Algorithms and ready to switch to OOPs and Databases
*   140 to 200 question on DS and Algo to be proficient for codeforces short contest
*   Good hold on OOP paradigm
*   Done with the second project with the documentation, code deployed on open source and lot of things to write on CV

How your CV looks like after you are done with 70 days of this program:

If this is something which you are looking forward to , join us.

**How do we help you?**



*   By building a quality team which helps each other to grow.
*   We help you to be consistent by sharing small daily and weekly goals just to get rid of the overwhelming amount of resources available online.
*   We help you dream big and go for learning without pressure of completing things which anyway gets you a job
*   We help you build habit of learning by pushing you everyday with project based learning in modular fashion
*   We provide you with concise handy notes to revise with the links to all important things which one must learn and know regarding Computer Science fundamentals.
*   We help you by discussing tough problems and helping you learn how to approach the problem

So with all these things you automatically become a learning beast which helps you to clear tests and get placement which is not our priority anyway. Leaning gets you all the worldly things in a seamless fashion, be it placement, job or competitive exams. 

**Problem solving **

2 questions of Data Structure and Algorithm everyday

2*7= 14 to 20 questions for the first week

**Core CS fundamental subject discussion**

Operating System, OOPs, Algorithm

Data Structure, DBMS and Computer Network 

Indexed resources on daily basis

Session Daily

Morning session: to give goals

evening session : for discussing the subject matter and clear  doubts to keep you going

Available almost every time on the community group to resolve your issues

"We break big goals into small achievable chunks for you"

Weekly meeting to discuss the project progress which we do from scratch.

We will start with OS, Algorithms, then OOPs, then Databases and eventually learn Computer Networks

**It's Boring plan ? Who studies when we can copy codes!!**

Well, there is always an easy path to satisfy yourself. Tough roads take you to a better place. So again choice is yours.

Woah! but if you don't do which other people don't, you will never have rock solid foundations and be better than the rest. Anyway our goal is to be better than our yesterday.

**But it takes a lot of time?**

Come on! What doesn’t take time? Building muscles, stamina and writing codes takes time and consistency.

But I want to be a better developer overnight! It doesn't happen like that.

**But I can't pay?**

Yeah! no issues !!

I won’t curtail your learning if you can’t pay. This is my promise to you

We never stopped you learning if you have financial issues and this day of decision will surely come several times in future as well but you'll be a bit late and regret the service which cost less than the price of weekly Idli/ Vada/ Samosa or Pizza.

So your dreams are costly and so we help you and we charge you for the amount of time we put in to help you out and give you structured team sessions and opportunity to learn and grow. If you don’t pay for services, how do you expect someone will pay you for what you learned?

Just for information, the article you just read took more than an hour to type. And the plan I made took countless days, several discussion sessions, numerous conversations and brainstorming to formalize to give you a better learning experience. So I charge for these small efforts!! Nothing hard.

If you can’t, I’m not harsh to stop you from learning. Just text me your reasons on
