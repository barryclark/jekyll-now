title: 'Here We Go '

	<l>After spending a couple of hours in the dawn hours of my Sunday morning, I am finally glad to say I have everything up and running. It was a great learning experience trying to get Jekyll to run through GitHub Pages and linking it to a free domain that I host on Namecheap. Students can take advantage of a free year of hosting with the .me domain name amongst other tools (which you can find [here] (https://education.github.com/pack). I would recommend this to those wanting to learn some coding while not being entirely sure if some of the paid hosting sites are worth it giving the advanced features they employ. NameCheap offers some great support through their friendly staff and their in depth documentation that would allow "noob friendly" installation possible.

	While I am still working on fixing the front-end of the site, the back end is all nice and clean. While older versions of Jekyll had a myriad of user unfriendly interfaces in order to support the uploading of blog posts , as of 8/24/16 there is a user friendly admin panel to use (which you can find  [here](http://https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin) I am still learning about the many plugins available. While I embark on another adventure, don’t get too used to the current look of the site, as I will make it look better and better. Thanks for being here with me on this first post and let’s see where it takes us.</l>
