There is a significant amount of subtle, yet precisely calibrated, styling to ensure
that your content is emphasized while still looking aesthetically pleasing.

All links are easy to [locate and discern](#), yet don't detract from the harmony
of a paragraph. The _same_ goes for italics and __bold__ elements. Even the the strikeout
works if <del>for some reason you need to update your post</del>. For consistency's sake,
<ins>The same goes for insertions</ins>, of course.

### Code, with syntax highlighting

Code blocks use the [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme. Both the light and
dark versions are included, so you can swap them out easily. _Solarized Dark_ is the default.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Awesome < ActiveRecord::Base
  include EvenMoreAwesome

  validates_presence_of :something
  validates :email, email_format: true

  def initialize(email, name = nil)
    self.email = email
    self.name = name
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

# Headings!

They're responsive, and well-proportioned (in `padding`, `line-height`, `margin`, and `font-size`).
They also heavily rely on the awesome utility, [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/).

##### They draw the perfect amount of attention

This allows your content to have the proper informational and contextual hierarchy. Yay.

### There are lists, too

  * Apples
  * Oranges
  * Potatoes
  * Milk

  1. Mow the lawn
  2. Feed the dog
  3. Dance

### Images look great, too

### There are also pretty colors

Also the result of [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/), you can <span class="bg-dark-gray white">highlight</span> certain components
of a <span class="red">post</span> <span class="mid-gray">with</span> <span class="green">CSS</span> <span class="orange">classes</span>.

I don't recommend using blue, though. It looks like a <span class="blue">link</span>.

### Stylish blockquotes included

You can use the markdown quote syntax, `>` for simple quotes.

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse quis porta mauris.

However, you need to inject html if you'd like a citation footer. I will be working on a way to
hopefully sidestep this inconvenience.

Happy writing.
