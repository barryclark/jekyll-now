title: Trying Travis CI
---

**Code Coverage** is a measurement of how many lines/blocks/arcs of your code are executed while the automated tests are running.

I was developing a shell as part of one of my course assignments (of CSE231). [The Code is hosted on GitHub and I plan to make the repository public, soon after the evaluations are done]

I am wanting to learn automated testing using Travis CI and probably packaging (makefiles) as a side benefit :) Let's give it a shot!
