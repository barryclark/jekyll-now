title: And so it begins... 30/10/2015
---

This is my very first post on my very own blog, and it’s safe to say I am very excited. I am a 24-year-old kitchen manager, I have a bright career ahead of me, but it is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. When I went to college in 2008 I did not know what I wanted to do either, so I decided to leave college for a full time job. and due to my hardworking nature I have risen through the ranks. 

I've decided to go back to college in September, and subsequently finally make it to university but not as any student, these days I will be known as a "mature student". Ultimately my end game is to get a job that I love, that fits around my family, and one that I can also create new software/hardware that the world could use. 

In less than 2 weeks I have gone from being unsure about my future, to having a path clearly drawn out. first and foremost, I want to apologize for my bad English writing skills. It never was my strong suit and hopefully you will see it improve along with my blogging skills over time.

 The First milestone I wanted to achieve, was to learn HTML and CSS. I did this using [Code academy](https://www.codecademy.com/). Don’t get me wrong am not a master at it but I’ve got the basics down and I can build a website now. Not very good I might add but you can check out my progress on [Github](https://github.com/wardy547) later.

 My next step was to find a project, and also get all the software in place to get coding. the software I have settled on is [Github](https://github.com/wardy547) to host my website and also [sublime text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) to edit my code. I just find it easy to use and very smooth. My First project is for my local boxing club, that website hasn’t gone live yet but you can see it on my Github, the link is down at the bottom of the page. I am currently working on this and will be talking about struggles in the design process in future posts.

 As you can see I am very new to the whole blogging world and markup language, and I also don’t know how long these posts are supposed to be, but hey ho what can you do. I am going to try and put posts up as often as possible, and also be as helpful as possible for new starters like myself. if you read this leave me a tweet or something to let me know what you thought.

 See you on the next one
