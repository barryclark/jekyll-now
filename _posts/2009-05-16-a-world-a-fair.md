For the ultimate in foreign food and culture, go to [the Dayton A World A'Fair](http://www.aworldafair.org/). They do it about once a year.

My brother and I went today. After eating some Greek (gyro) and Lebanese goodness, we checked out the dance stage they have. First, we saw some Scottish dancers. Pretty cool but seemed kinda… calm. Next were the Egyptian(ish) belly dancers. They way they move…

Anyways what I thought was really cool was the Kenyan Safari Acrobats. Here’s a YouTube:

Afterward, we went and ate some Italian dessert deliciousness. I had some kind of coffee cake ice cream and a chocolate mousse pie.

Until next time
