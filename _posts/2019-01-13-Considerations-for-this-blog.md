title: Considerations for this blog
---

* Using Tags
* Using highligting of certain posts
* Changing the theme
* Maybe give [CarbonAds](https://www.carbonads.net/blogs)

* <https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/> Awesome blog website by a kid, this particular page talks about how to use categories. But given that the theme is also nice, I could just take all of it perhaps (it is on GitHub). Will have to check compatibility
	* His [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/codinfox/codinfox-lanyon)
	* [Blog Homepage](http://codinfox.github.io/blog/)
	* Reading [more](http://codinfox.github.io/about/) about him, he is not a kid. He is a grown up, who graduated from CMU!
* [Deleting Fork Dependency of a GitHub Repo #SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16052477/delete-fork-dependency-of-a-github-repository)
* [HYDE!](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) - AWESOME THEME
	* [Live Preview](http://hyde.getpoole.com/)
	* [GitHub](https://github.com/poole/hyde)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/), A similar theme with a Sidebar from left; which is auto-hidden. Both are oficial themes of [Poole](http://getpoole.com/).
* [Left](https://zachholman.com/posts/left/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/holman/left)
