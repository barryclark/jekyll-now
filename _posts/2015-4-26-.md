##Welcome to the Wheeler Computational Biology Lab

Our broad goal is to better understand how genetic variation leads to phenotypic variation for complex traits including disease susceptibility and drug response. 
We develop systems approaches to complex trait prediction by building computational models that leverage and integrate similarity in genetic, transcriptomic or other omics-level data.
