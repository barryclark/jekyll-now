Inspired by the Clickhole/Onion article "[Embarrassing: The U.S. Is Ranked 182nd In The World Alphabetically](http://www.clickhole.com/article/embarrassing-us-ranked-182nd-world-alphabetically-1855)" I decided to take action. 

### Finding the List of Countries

The article states that the list of countries is 195 countries. The [US Department of State](https://www.state.gov/misc/list/) lists 203 different countries (204 if you count East Timor and Timor-Leste separately). What's really infuriating about this list is that *it doesn't even contain the United States*.

Next to the source of all knowledge. No, not Google - Wikipedia. Wikipedia lists [193 "member states" of the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations), of which the United States is 185 alphabetically:

position | country
--- | ---
183 | United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
184 | United Republic of Tanzania
185 | United States of America
186 | Uruguay
187 | Uzbekistan


I guess 193 is close enough to 195 and 185 is close enough to 182, plus the fact the US is on this list, so we'll use this list.

### Going French

French for "United States of America" is "&Eacute;tats-Unis d'Am&eacute;rique." So if we use the French language in our list, the United States, er, I mean, &Eacute;tats-Unis becomes number 58 alphabetically:

position | country
--- | ---
56 | Eritrea
57 | Estonia
58 | &Eacute;tats-Unis d'Am&eacute;rique
59 | Ethiopia
60 | Fiji

However, with the advent of [Freedom Fries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_fries), some people might not be too keen on using the French language to name the country.

### Repositioning Words

You know how in certain lists, certain parts of the title are out of order? For instance, "[Great Gatsby, The](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1987817990?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)." The list already does that with Iran, calling it "Iran (Islamic Republic of)."

So let's refer to this great country as "America, United States of." Now we're getting someplace - number four alphabetically:

position | country
1 | Afghanistan
2 | Albania
3 | Algeria
4 | America, United States of
5 | Andorra
6 | Angola

### Now what? 

Currently, Afghanistan is number one. To get to number one, we have to somehow put a letter that comes before "f" after the first "A" - so that means either a, b, c, d, or e. We could try replacing the "m":

> Aaerica, Aberica, Acerica, Aderica, Aerica.

None of these make sense. Okay, let's inserting between the "A" and "m":

> Aamerica, Abmerica, Acmerica, Admerica, Aemerica

Honestly, I prefer "Aamerica, United States of" or even "A America, United States of." We can't call it just America, though, or people might think we're [the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas).
