<h3>Week :three: </h3>
***  
__:question: Questions :question:__  
*1. What did you do this past week?*  
    My partner and I met up and got Project 2 set up and did most except for the Netflix_eval. 
    Our class also had Ben Porter from Main Street Hub come in and talk.
    
*2. What's in your way?*  
    Just finishing up Project #2 and I have an exam on Wednesday in another class.
    
*3. What will you do next week?*  
    We'll finish up our Project #2

    I feel like I've learned a lot in this class already. My partner for my project is awesome and 
  knows helpful command line tips. I really enjoy this class except the quizzes are my low point.
  You have to be pretty careful about reading questions. BUT there's a time limit of like 3 mins 
  so don't run out of time either.
    As mentioned above, we had a speaker in class. Ben Porter a UT Alum and works at Main Street Hub. 
  It was pretty cool and I'm glad Downing sees value in these kinds of things. I've done Longhorn Startup
  Lab one semester and really enjoyed having speakers who have been in the Tech business and can give us
  real world advice. I look forward to the next speaker Downing has for us.

I found this cool thing that will make your computer speak whatever you input into it.
