> "My daily affairs are quite ordinary;  
> But I'm in total harmony with them.  
> I don't hold on to anything, don't reject anything;  
> Nowhere an obstacle or conflict.  
> Who cares about wealth and honor?  
> Even the poorest thing shines.  
> My miraculous power and spiritual activity:  
> Drawing water and carrying wood."
