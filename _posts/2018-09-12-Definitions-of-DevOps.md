title: Definitions of DevOps
---

When people use the term "DevOps", what do they mean? Here are the definitions I have seen people use:

0: SysOps. DevOps is just a new name without a change in the way people work to maintain and monitor computer systems.

1: SysOps use dev techniques. Configuration-as-code. Scripting to automate your work.

2: A shift in the relationship between SysOps and Development. Breaking down the knowledge and cultural silos in the organization, so these groups work together more effectively.

3: A merging of "Dev" and "Ops". The development team is responsible for maintaining the computer systems. This closes the dev-ops loop.

I'm not saying that any one of these is the only true definition of DevOps, but it's important that we know what we're talking about.

Do these definitions resonate with you? What other definitions have you seen?

EDIT: @jamesshore has [seen another definition](https://twitter.com/jamesshore/status/1086510556201213952): Ops for dev environments, in contrast to ProdOps.
