## Calendar v0 : NEED

Far far away... It was an IDEA to automate all the marketing activities using one tool. This is still an issue and still a very ambitious plan to do. But i want to take a shot and put my hand on it. 

As a marketing manager in digital[*] i'm always (still) suffering about 2 things:

1) I have no idea what other departments do. In any company i worked there was no unique transparent system of information flow - one single source of truth and (what is more important) one single planning tool. So i often need to physically meet with other teams just to understand what is going on and we can collaborate.

2) When you work in a corporate business most of your time you are working for several brands / projects / tasks with different KPIs and probably needs for share of your attention and expertise. It could left a total mess in your brain even if you are really good in planning.

So i started to thing about it from the point of any tool (as always, ehh) that could help me somehow. 

This will be my list of needs for such tool:

- Simplicity. I should always understand how to set up tasks, to schedule projects, to see the progress.. This is a real challenge for user interface - as soon as now as a consumer i want to operate everything as easy as Uber can bring me the cab; i want to operate my business tasks as simple as it possible.

- Cross-communication. I mean departments and partners. It should be unique platform that any team in my company, or any partner's team will (could) work with. My planning should mirroring their planning.

- Task Management. As soon as we are talking about platform for planing - it would be cool if it could also do something with all my plans. So i'm thinking about task management (like real one, not just notepad with bunch of dates) with some automation rules - sending some tasks to responsible person, to agency, to media buying script, etc.

- Familiarity. Anybody uses the tool for the first time should understand the principle immediately. So i would prefer to have calendar as a basis - everybody use it.

- Integrations. As soon as infrastructure is a cost consuming thing, this tool should be flexible enough to be integrated with all huge corporation software like SAP, MS soft, etc.

- Accessibility and speed. Cloud-based with web-interface and / or App.


I will do a desk research to understand if there is anything close on the market i can really use in my day-to-day work.
