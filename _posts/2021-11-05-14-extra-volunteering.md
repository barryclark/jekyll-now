title: Deep Lore - Hospital Volunteering
---

Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock - Deep Lore Edition**! Since I’ve mentioned about my hospital volunteering before, I’ll talk more about **my experience as a hospital volunteer so far.**

*Why?* The past couple of weeks have been a slew of logistics, phone calls, and text messages on my side - mostly related to adulting. I didn’t have enough material to write a normal blog post that:
1. was interesting for the reader.
2. was interesting for me to write, because honestly there are a thousand generic time management articles in the Internet.
3. didn’t just involve a million pictures of Monty, even though I'd be happy to do that too. Oh wait...

### Background

I started volunteering in the hospital in mid-March of 2021. At that time, the pandemic was tapering down after a surge during the winter. We hear about the [ICU department within hospitals across the US being overwhelmed](https://www.osfhealthcare.org/blog/what-is-the-icu-and-why-do-covid-19-patients-end-up-there/) on the news. I wanted to learn more about what went on in a hospital. Without getting too personal and also fortunately, I haven’t set foot in a hospital in around 15 years. I did a few one-time volunteering shifts at other organizations, but I sought for something more consistent and more aligned with my interests. (Also, yes, I can be a little sadistic with what exactly "aligned with my interests" if I chose a hospital.) After chatting with the hospital volunteer coordinator on options. I was assigned to [a med-surg unit](https://www.hosthealthcare.com/blog/what-is-med-surg-nursing/) as a good way to help out both patients and staff.

My first shift was honestly a bit overwhelming. I was nervous and utterly ignorant on what was going on around me. (Like, [what the heck does “pulse-ox” mean](https://www.healthline.com/health/normal-blood-oxygen-level)? Where are the glove boxes exactly? Who do I talk to for XYZ? Oops, I asked the wrong person.) On top of that, half of the patient rooms on my assigned floor were COVID-19 isolation rooms. Welp. (Note: I wasn't allowed to go near the rooms, and the rooms were properly set up to contain the virus, but it was still a jumpscare for me.)

The volunteer coordinator reassured me that it would take a few shifts to acclimate to the hospital environment. I also had to readjust my thinking that:
* I was in the same position in my first tech job, where I knew none of the acronyms or unspoken processes worked. It took time to passively absorb the information and actively do my tasks to gain experience.
* I was there to help patients in any way I could, and was expected to delegate if there was a task I couldn't do, or ask questions if I didn't know something.

It did take a few shifts to get adjusted, and a couple more shifts to feel confident with my abilities and knowledge. Some tasks that I've done:
* I primarily round with patients, which means going around and asking if patients need anything (water, extra blankets, speaking with a healthcare professional).
* With help from a few nurse aides, I restock the [phlebotomy](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-phlebotomy) carts, which the nurses and nurse aides use to draw blood with all the supplies conveniently stored in one mobile place.
* I also restock [isolation carts for rooms with particularly infectious diseases](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000446.htm).
* I ferry blood samples down [to the laboratory](https://laboratorycareer.com/laboratory/) so the samples are tested before they clot, and saves nurses time from making the trek themselves.
* There are many more small tasks that I help out but can’t list them all.

I’ve also done a lot of passive observations in my time.
* I learned how the nurses and nurse aides worked on the floor, and what responsibilities they had. tl;dr there's a lot of responsibilities.
* I've worked with patients on whatever they need at the time. Patients may be in pain, asleep, confused, alert, bored, or ready to leave the hospital. They are of different genders, races, languages, and so much more. Occasionally, they are accompanied by a relative or aide to help them on their needs.
* The [unit clerk](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/unit-clerk-duties) kept the unit working on the administrative side.
* I've seen medical teams chatting with patients and each other. They appear and disappear quickly as they move from floor to floor.
* I watch people from the kitchen serve meals, transporters ferrying patients for procedures, environmental services keeping the floor clean, security guards occasionally patrolling, [physical therapists](https://www.apta.org/your-career/careers-in-physical-therapy/becoming-a-pt) helping patients walk... Many staff members make the unit buzz!

Not to mention all of the technological beeping around the floor. The [call bell](https://www.hqinstitute.org/post/no-pass-zone-patient-safety) rings within the entire unit, waiting to be answered. The [telemetry dashboard](https://nationaltelemetryassociation.org/the-importance-of-a-telemetry-unit-in-hospitals/) beeps whenever a patient is not doing well from a cardiovascular perspective. IVs that need sorting out start beeping obnoxiously in a patient's room. And so many more different beeps, tones, and rings.

Yes, I’m throwing out a ton of words that took me months to get straight. And I still routinely ask questions on where an item is in the supply closet. As many staff members have said, it just takes a lot of time and experience to be more efficient.

### What I’ve learned

In all these months of volunteering, I’ve learned a lot from the experience. Of course, being me, I will definitely draw these experiences to my own life outside of the hospital.

**There is a LOT of communication and teamwork in the unit.** Within the floor, there are tasks that can impact a patient’s well-being or health. When a task needed to be done, one would do the task and promptly follow up. If there was a task that someone couldn't do (because of time constraints, inexperience, lack of strength), folks would jump in to help. Communication was most effective in-person, but I do also see work phones and chat messaging used. It would be detrimental for a task to not be done due to a lack of communication or error.

Similarly, if a patient asked for something, I would need to promptly return with the request completed, or explain to the patient why I couldn’t fulfill the request (nurse is busy, nurse doesn’t allow it, I'm waiting for another person to follow-up). As a patient, the worst thing to happen is to have someone promise to do something, then disappear without a word!

A situation that I didn’t expect was communicating with patients and their family in Chinese. For those who didn’t speak English well enough, I often became an intermediate between them and the nursing staff, if other bilingual staff weren't available. I’m not allowed to be an interpreter for medical or logistical information, but I could help relay concerns or fulfill requests more quickly.

**It takes time to acclimate to the environment, and to be comfortable asking questions.** As you can imagine, a hospital is busy as heck. At certain times, staff gets tense and may not be as receptive to help a volunteer. It took some time to get a feel of the ebb and flow of the floor. I also learned not be afraid of asking questions, especially since it meant I would be able to work more independently in future shifts. I appreciated the staff who pulled me in to help with various tasks.

**Volunteering can get boring, or it can get hectic.** In normal and calm times, yes, I get bored on my shift. I complete my rounding and restocking. Patients don’t need anything or are asleep, carts are restocked, and staff don’t have anything they need assistance with. Water refills are also not the most exciting things to do in my spare time.

However, those calm times should be treasured. There are times where I’m on my feet for the majority of my shift because the floor is just hectic for reasons (short of staff, difficult patients, too many tasks to do at the same time). Sometimes I get discouraged because of an upset patient. I can't fulfill a request because I'm a volunteer with no medical licensure or information about patient status. However, another patient gave me advice to “not take it personally” because patients may act out of the situation, rather than the person.

[**Yes, there is a nurse shortage.**](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/hospitals-innovate-amid-dire-nursing-shortages) The nurses are stressed out with the trauma from COVID-19 on top of more patients to take care of, staff churn, unfair compensation, and toxic working environments. [A few nurses turn to travel nursing](https://nurse.org/articles/how-to-make-the-most-money-as-a-travel-nurse/) because of the better compensation. Heck, I’ve helped some new nurses in the past few weeks since it would free up some time for the more seasoned and stressed nurses.

**I have SO much appreciation for the nurses and staff.** Whether through observation or chatting with the staff, I have a great appreciation for what they do as a full-time job. As I work most closely with the nurses and nurse aide, I have the most appreciation for them in particular. I only spent 4 to 6 hours per shift, while nurses stayed for a full 12 hours taking care of multiple patients. When the floor gets busy or there is an emergency, staff mobilize quickly. There are times when nurses barely have the time to order lunch online, much less actually eat lunch!

**Volunteering is fulfilling!** Volunteering should be done to benefit the other, but boy does it feel good doing a good deed! Staff members are busy as heck, but it's great to be able to help out in the moment. At times, I've helped out the newer staff with navigating the many rooms and corridors of the hospital. I've helped patients get an extra cup of ice water, help adjust their bed, or provide some good company. Recently, I've bumped into a former inpatient I've met in several of my shifts, and was overjoyed to see them completely healthy!

**[There’s HIPAA](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html), so no specific stories or pictures from me.** I’ve heard and seen many events on the floor that I don’t think I’m allowed to talk about on the Internet. There was gross stuff involved. There were laughs and tears. I’ve enjoyed eating lunch with staff who had the time for a break. I left some shifts feeling great, while other times I left terrible. I've primarily met patients who could be my grandparents, but the diversity of patients in NYC have been amazing. I've seen patients who I've recognized shift after shift, hearing their progress or their worsening condition. Every shift was a different experience.

### What's next?

I will be nearing 9 months of volunteering in the hospital, which is the expected timeframe for this specific hospital. I have the choice to continue volunteering, stop volunteering, or switch to a different department with a different set of responsibilities. While I enjoy volunteering in the med-surg unit, the shifts require a consistent schedule that have been less convenient to navigate than I thought. Plus, more volunteers have been in the hospital since I joined, so I may step down so others have the chance to step up and get the experience I've gotten.

I'll most likely take a few weeks' break from volunteering, so I can enjoy the end-of-year holidays and re-evaluate what I'd like to do for my remaining months in my gap year. Stay tuned!
