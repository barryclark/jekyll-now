### What is binary?
At their most simple level, computers are basically a collection of circuits turned on or off. We use __binary__ to represent these circuits.

__Binary__ is a counting system. Counting systems are the symbols used to represent numbers. The most widely used counting system is known as __decimal__. This is the you are familiar with and use in your every day life. In decimal, there are ten symbols `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` used to represent different numbers (zero through nine). When we run out of symbols to represent our numbers, we add a new __place value__. For example, 9 is the highest symbol in the decimal number system, when we represent the number ten, we add a place value and start the one's place at 0.
`9 -> 10`

Binary is a counting system that only uses two symbols to represent a number (1 and 0). We use it for computer science because it allows us to represent a semi-conductor that is turned off with a 0. We represent a semi-conductor that is turned on with a 1. You can also think of binary numbers in terms of __True__ (1) and __False__ (0). We call each place value that contains a 1 or a 0 a __bit__. 8 bits make up one __byte__. Modern computers are built on millions of bytes that are connected.

### How to Convert between Binary and Decimal
Binary and decimal essentially the same thing. They are both counting systems used to represent numerical values. Whether we write the number _seven_ as `111` (in binary) or `7` (in decimal) does not make a difference to humans. They both represent a value of _seven_. Computers use binary because it allows for mathematical operations to be implemented as circuits. Doing this with a decimal counting system would be impossible. In order to make binary operations more readable to humans, it is often useful to convert from binary to decimal.

##### Convert from Binary to Decimal.
1. Index the binary number
![indexed binary number](#)
Before we convert our number, we must take a look at the indices or digit places of the binary number. We list the indices as above, with the right-most index starting at zero. Then we increase the index by one with every step to the left. Just like in decimal, as we move further to the left in our number, our digits __increase in significance__ meaning that digits further to the left represent larger numbers.
2. We convert binary to decimal summing `d*2^i` over all indices. `i` represents the index and `d` represents the value stored at the index. So we convert the number above like this:
![binary to decimal conversion](#)

##### Convert from Decimal to Binary
To convert a decimal number to binary, we do the __inverse__ of the operation above. The steps are detailed below
1. Find the largest index. We can use __logarithms__ for this. The largest index for any number `n` is equal to `floor(log2(n))`
![largest index formula](#)
The symbols that look like L's enclosing the log operator are known as the `floor` operator. They simply indicate to round down to the nearest whole number. For example `floor(4.5) = 4`. To convert the decimal number `12` to binary first we find the largest index (L).
![largest index 12](#)
The value of `n` at this index will be `1`.

2. Convert the remaining digits to binary. We know `2^3 = 8` and we are trying to convert the number `12` to binary. In the last step, we concluded that the value at index=3 is 1. The decimal value of the number `1000` is `8`. So we subtract `1*2^3` from `n`. This result gives us:
`12-8 = 4`.

3. Represent the remaining digits in binary. We must repeat steps 1-2 until our remainder is zero. So we now convert the number `4` to binary. The largest index of `4` is `2`. So no we do `4 - 1*2^(2) = 0`. Since this equals zero, we know we are done. So the value of `12` in binary is `1100`.

### Activity 1: Numbers as Redstone
Using what you know about binary, pick a random positive number and write it by turning `Redstone torches` (or `Redstone Lamps`) on or off. Redstone torches that are turned on represent a 1 and Redstone torches that are turned off represent a 0.
