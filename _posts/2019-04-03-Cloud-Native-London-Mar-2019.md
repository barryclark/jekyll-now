We were inundated for our April Cloud Native London meetup - with a bigger and more diverse crowd than we’ve ever had before! We also had three fantastic speakers.

First up as always, thanks to our sponsors [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Contino](https://www.contino.io/), [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/) and [Component Soft](https://www.componentsoft.io/)


First was a talk on connecting your microservices with Istio, then running HPC Workloads via Jupyter, wrapping up with Codilime’s journey to Kubernetes .

Laszlo Budai from Component Soft gave a talk about ["Istio – connect your microservices in a secure way"](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/12555-cloud-native), explaining that:

* Component Soft is an IT training and consulting company focusing on open source cloud and cloud native technologies and offering Docker, Kubernetes and Istio trainings in London, Berlin, Budapest as well as in live online and private class format in whole Europe.
* Istio (istio.io), an open source service mesh, transparently integrates into your #CloudNative application and will provide you a bunch of nice features like intelligent routing, end-to-end authentication, access control, observability etc. You can learn more about it at https://bit.ly/2uJzalx.
* Is securing service-to-service communication of your #CloudNative application a headache for you? Not anymore! In my talk at #CludNativeLon I have demonstrated how Istio (istio.io) provides a secure communication channel between your microservices. Want to know more? Check this out: https://bit.ly/2uJzalx.

Following that, Dr Christoper Woods from Bristol University discussed ["Running HPC Workloads via Jupyter using Kubernetes and Fn serverless functions"](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13710-running-hpc-workloads-via-jupyter-using-kubernetes-and-fn-serverless-functions), mentioning that:

* Jupyter notebooks provide a great interface for researchers to build and share reproducible research computing and data analysis experiments.
* Jupyter can run on Kubernetes, but mechanisms are needed to allow compute or data analysis triggered in a notebook to burst out onto dedicated HPC resources.
* Fn is an open source serverless framework that can be used to wrap-up simulations and analyses into triggerable, autoscaling functions.

Finally Tomasz Madycki from CodiLime gave us a talk on ["Our journey to Kubernetes"](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13711-our-journey-to-kubernetes). He talked about:


* his experience with migration to Kubernetes on GCP
* the pros and cons of the lift and shift approach
* how to securely connect network devices to Kubernetes internal network
* different ways of setting up data cluster services
* tools used for the deployment process
