This chapter covers how to add new files, pages, and images to your repository by using browser tools or keyboard commands. For more information on these tools, the [GitHub][ic] guide page probably has tutorials. If not, use [google][ok] or https://www.yahoo.ca.

*Images*

To add an image from the web, check out the [Fireball][df] website. You can also practice using markdown there. The image will appear like this:

![hello](http://www.axialis.com/objects/ip_icon_04_data/icon-vista.ico "Hallo")

*Code View*

To create code blocks, put four spaces before your text. Inline code uses backticks `(upper left corner of most keyboards)`, not single quotes `(')`. Go here [womp][womp] for more info
