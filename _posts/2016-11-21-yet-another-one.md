### Textual Poaching 

## Research Question:

- Topic -- Audience responses to seeing homosexuality in characters on t.v. 

- Question -- What are the effects of text attacks on the actual text and on the audiences.

- Significance -- Will help us understand stratagies that can be applied to the audiences for future uses. 


## Argument:

- Claim -- gamekeeping and textual poaching is responsible for homophobic tendencies. 

- Reasons -- more people are reacting with homophobic tendencies rather than taking the "initiative" to be homophobic. Becomes more accepted by the masses. 

- Evidence -- the prime evidence for Bury is online forums, and it support her claims

- Alternatives -- the alternative idea is that most of the audience is silent because they are are staight and would rather stay out of sight during these conflicts.
