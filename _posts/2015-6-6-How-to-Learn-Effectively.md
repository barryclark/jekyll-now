title: How to Learn Effectively
---

When I started my 7 month journey at the [Turing School of Software & Design](http://turing.io/) I was worried that my health would take a significant nosedive during the intensive program. Luckily, the instructors at Turing are as passionate and educated about teaching as they are about programming. To my pleasant surprise, lectures are broken up into 25 minute segments known as Pomodoros (or Pomodori if you're Italian). Pomodoros are the result of research that has shown people tend to learn and retain information better when they break up their learning, traditionally into 25 minute segments with 5 minute breaks in between. That is about the extent to which the [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) is used at Turing. There was little mandate on how to effectively utilize these breaks.

One of my classmates, [Justin Holzmann](http://www.justinholzmann.com/), and I somehow started doing pushups and air squats during our Pomodoro breaks. (I think it may have started after I brought up that I had begun doing [7 Minute Workouts](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/) in preparation for starting at Turing.) I later modified these to plyometric pushups and squats, and we added the occasional pullups after one of our instructors, [Mike Dao](http://ploos.io/), told us about a climbing training board mounted in one of the classrooms. A few other students would join in every now and then, but for the most part people would laugh or look at us like we were crazy. As silly as we may look, I am happy we started doing these simple exercises during our Pomodoro breaks.

Research has shown that sitting for long periods of time is bad for your health. Even exercising an hour at the gym each day cannot make up for the damage done sitting all day at work or school. You must get up and move around regularly. Getting up every 25 minutes helps with this. Not only do we get up out of our chairs, we get a small amount of simple exercise done each break. This adds up throughout each day. Our quick 10-15 rep exercises can add up to a cumulative total of 200+ pushups and squats each day!

Even if we didn't do pushups and squats, just getting up out of our seats for 5 minutes to walk around, get a drink of water, take our mind off of things, and/or socialize provided immense benefits. **The absolute worst thing you can do with your Pomodoro break is to continue sitting or staring at your computer screen.**

We intuitively knew this already, but a post I read on the official Pomodoro Technique website confirmed that what were doing was right:

So start doing your Pomodoros each day, and *respect* the Pomorodo break.

If you want a good, simple, *free* Pomodoro timer for your Mac, check out [Pomodoro One](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoro-one/id907364780). It's what many of us use at Turing.
