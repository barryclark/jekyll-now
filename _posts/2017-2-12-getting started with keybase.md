I recently got an invite for the excellent [Keybase](https://keybase.io).

Managing PGP keys has always been fairly clunky, but Keybase makes this much simpler - and also adds loads of ways to verify who/what you 'are' on the web. For example, mine include this blog:

The desktop app is nice, too - and the recommended way of using Keybase. It includes (all encrypted) chat, filesharing, and verification using personal devices, to name a few.

One of the more cool features is the ability to message someone **not on Keybase yet** - below I've messaged my good friend [@ticarpi](https://www.twitter.com/ticarpi "@ticarpi on twitter"). He hasn't signed up for Keybase yet - but messaging him (at his @ticarpi twitter handle) meant he's been automatically sent an invite, and verifiying he owns @ticarpi will unlock the message I've sent him. Very nifty!

All in all, I'm loving Keybase. It's got some great features, is easy-to-use, and also looks really slick. I've also got invites to give away - so send me a DM [@GeorgeTweeted](https://www.twitter.com/georgetweeted "@GeorgeTweeted on Twitter") for one. Have a go, and let me know what you think!
