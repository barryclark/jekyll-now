Welcome Back

I hope this blogs finds you not in a paniced state

Last week I briefly mentioned a few readings which can be found here:

Disney Princess Movies - https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/25/researchers-have-discovered-a-major-problem-with-the-little-mermaid-and-other-disney-movies/

Female Lines in... - http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/9/8920221/tumblr-dylan-marron-representation-race-Hollywood-film

To quickly recap, these readings inlarge corvered the lack for speaking lines for women in films.  Continuing this we conducted our own study with a networking exercise on the pilot for "Supergirl" where we noted the number of lines spoken by men and women, number of male and female characters, and total time spent speaking by each gender.  

Although we have not compiled the classes data I was pleasantly surprised by my data that I had recorded on the number of male characters, time spent talking by men, and number of speaking lines for men.  My data showed that in the approx. 45 min long Pilot there were 12 male characters with roughly 100 speaking lines split-up amongst them which totaled to roughly 9 min. and 12 sec. of the entire episode.  I am plesantly surprised by this because, when comparing it to some of the disney princess movies form the late 90's that were analyzed in the above readings men held over 60% of the speaking lines which by comparison of the time where men are speaking in super girl take up 20% of the entire episode which a more reasonable amount for a storyline with a female protagonist.  However, this does show a fairly stark contrast between the two especially when you realize the release date of the latest 90's Disney movie and the "Supergirl" pilot are only 15 years apart. Adding to this is that the target audience of the 90's Disney princesss movies is likely the same generation, just older, that "Supergirl" is targeted to, which is very reassuring proof that visual entertainment producers are making a concious effort to promote strong female characters as they move forward.
