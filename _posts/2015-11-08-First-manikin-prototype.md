After about a dozen hours working on this, I now have a super simple prototype running:

<figure class="content-youtube">
	<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/l9-G2wMlP-s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<figcaption>The 2015 version is so much smoother.</figcaption>
</figure>

Right now the frames are assembled on the fly, meaning those are not sprites in the animation, but eventually I'll be generating those for export.

Check out the [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/mikaelgramont/manikin).
