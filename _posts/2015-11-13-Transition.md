Transition... 

I must say I am finding it hard to transition from a cook to a coder, there are so many different languages, and variations of languages to learn, that sometimes I just don’t know where to start. So far I have learnt how to use HTML and CSS to build websites but I haven’t got as far as JavaScript yet. PHP and Ruby are way out of my comfort zone. But I feel like I’m being forced into learning Ruby with this blog. I need to learn Ruby to check my Posts offline before I make them live. All of this is very daunting but thankfully I have a couple of friends who know what they are doing. Maybe it’s the best thing for me, being thrown in at the deep end and forced to learn quick. All I know is, I really want this blog to go well, so I will learn everything about Jekyll until its perfect.

My learning process at the minute is me trying to do something, failing, and then googling it and asking friends until I have sorted it.  Is this how everyone starts? I’m not sure. But it seems to be working for me, I think I’ve learnt a lot in a short space of time, considering I’m doing all of this around a very high stress job. and also trying to have the perfect balance of family life, and work. I don’t think my family should suffer because I have a new hobby or want a new career. 

Working in a kitchen has been my only full time job, and I do not know how I’m going to feel when one day I have to give it up, which I will have to If I ever plan on having a career in the computer industry.  Like I mentioned it is a very stressful job, but I think that’s why I like it. A part of me likes the thrill of the pressure being on, and when we get a rush at work, that is when I come alive because you know you have to step your game up. If you do not then the food will go out horrible or cold and you will lose money, or your reputation or worse your valued customers. 

Will I ever be able to find the same thrill in coding I’m not sure. Not at this level anyway, but when I’m at the top of my game and a website or a network is on my shoulders, or a deadline is looming. I am hoping I will get that same rush. So I can hit that next level and see what I’m really capable of.  You never know I may be the next Steve Wozniak or Dennis Ritchie.

Please comment if you have read this, share it, email me if you have advice. I am very open to suggestions or help. I would also very much welcome some acknowledgement that someone is reading these posts. 

See you on the next one.
