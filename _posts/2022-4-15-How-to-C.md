---

Hello geeks,

In this article, I am going to show you how to use TurboC in just your broswer without installing anything

# Setup
Here's how to Setup Turbo C without installing anything on your PC.
### 1. Go to https://www.onlinegdb.com/

### 2. In the top left corner, Select '**Language**' as "**C (TurboC)**" from the drop down menu.

### 3. **Type Your Code**
By default, onlineGDB loads in some code. You can delete this code and place your own code instead.

### 4. **Run Your Code**
Run your code by pressing the green Run button or if you want to be fast, by 'F9' on your keyboard.

# Now You Can Run All Your Code Without Installing A Thing
Congratulations! Now you can practice programming in C as much as you want.
