It's been a while since I posted something, so I thought I'd throw this up:

> That seems to be one of the key suggestions of a report from the National Endowment for Science, Arts and Technology (NESTA) in the UK that looks at ways of increasing the pipeline of talent for the booming games industry in the country.
>
> The report is the culmination of a review conducted by Ian Livingstone, life president of Square Enix, and Alex Hope, managing director of VFX company Double Negative; the authors have made 20 recommendations to the Department of Education to chart out a path for the UK to emerge as a world leader in games production and visual effects.

When I was little I wanted to make video games when I grew up. Don't know if I'll end up doing that still.

Until next time
