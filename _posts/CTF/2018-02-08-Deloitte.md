# Introduction
During January 2018, 15 competed for the chance to compete in the finals to earn cash prizes and the chance to be part of Deloittes work force. The CTF orientated around nine challenges which encompassed different skillsets ranging from Cryptopgraphy, Networking, Web, Reverse Engineering, Misc(Software related understanding) and Exploitation. The challenges that were layed out were engineered to bring out critical thinking and teamwork (and it did just that). This post will be split into two parts experience and challenges that were completed.

# Challenges
## So Close
So Close is a miscellaneous challenge which is to demonstrate the understanding of a particular service or type of software which in this instance is Vim the popular text editor. The clue for this challenge is to find get access to the flag after the admin has removed all permissions from the file.

![So Close Challenge](/images/deloitte/so_close_challenge.png "Description of the so close challenge")

Starting the instance we get an inital shell which has the flag.txt file along with no permissions as stated by the introduction to the challenge.

![So Close Flag.txt](/images/deloitte/so_close_flag.png "Flag.txt with no permissions")

Going from the introduction text for the challenge it is said that the Vim process is still open. If we use the command "ps aux" we should see a vim process is still open.

![So Close Vim process](/images/deloitte/so_close_ps_aux.png "Vim process Open on 16")

This indicates that the Vim process is running on process id 16. It is also important to run vim -r to check to see if there are any swap files to recover, however as the screenshot demonstrates there isn't.

![So Close Vim Recovery](/images/deloitte/so_close_vim_recovery.png "Vim Recovery")

Hitting the search engines a previous question has been asked at [stack overflow](https://superuser.com/questions/283102/how-to-recover-deleted-file-if-it-is-still-opened-by-some-process) which shows that it is possible to gather information from the process id within the directory /proc/.

Traversing to that location and using information of the process id we gathered from "ps aux" and using the command cat /proc/16/fd/4 presents the flag as shown in the image below.

### Conclusion
This challenge was the first that many universities conquered and it was the first our team conquered. The challenge was to demonstrates that popular tools that are used in everyday use have some hidden talents that not alot of people have seen.

## Ping Pong
The Ping Pong challenge was a fun but manual challenge. Using a PCAP file to create a breadcrumb approach to a particular flag was an interesting challenge. The challenge clue shows that information has been captured between a client and server which in turn shows a ping and then a pong.

![Ping Pong Challenge](/images/deloitte/ping_pong_challenge.png "Ping Pong Challenge")

As we are dealing with a PCAP file the first tool that jumps into anyones head is ![wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). Opening the PCAP file shows that we have a HTTP request along with a full handshake between the client and server.
![Ping Pong Pcap](/images/deloitte/ping_pong_pcap.png "Ping Pong PCAP file")

When opening the PCAP and looking at the HTTP ping packets there is a corresponding number. Opening the packet using the "follow tcp stream" the resulting pong value is encapsulated.

![Ping Pong Pong Value](/images/deloitte/ping_pong.png "Pong Value")

Additionally within the PCAP file the ping packet numbering isn't in a sequential order as it goes "23" -> "16" -> "28" -> etc... which indicates that we as analysts must put them in order. Using the filter field within wireshark we can extract just the HTTP requests.

![Wireshark Filter](/images/deloitte/wireshark_filter.png "http.request.method == GET")

Writing the values and the corresponding value in order we can then reconstruct the sentence starting from "0" to the last value until we get the flag.

I have also attached the text file for anyone wanting to double check their values.

### Challenge Conclusion
This challenge was fairly straight forward but the manual presence to this challenge is time consuming, but demonstrates the skill and importance of identifying patterns (well done to K260 for noticing the pattern so fast).

## Rainman's Echo
Rainmans echo is an echo service running on 10.6.0.2:7777, with the idea of everything being returned after typing looking for an escape character was the first stage.
![Rainman Connect](/images/deloitte/rainman_connect.png "Rainmans Echo Netcat Connect")

Typing a message returns the response hence the name "Rainmans Echo", going through possible escape characters we find that "%" is an escape character as the symbol isn't returned. This indicates the program is a possible C program, which leads to the assumption that the service has a format string vulnerability.
![Rainmans Echo Escape Character](/images/deloitte/rainman_escape_character.png "Format String Vulnerability")

The clue for the flag indicates that the flag is stored in an environment block which is stored on the stack. 
![Rainmans Echo Clue](/images/deloitte/rainman_clue.png "Rainman Echo clue")

We know that we can use the "%" to escape and print values from the stack using the "%x" "%s" and "%p" sign. However, for this case we want the string representation of the environment variable which means we need "%s". Running command "%01$s" will print the value at location "01" in a string format as specified by the "$s". Doing this manually can take some time but will result in the flag.

![Rainmans Echo Escape Character](/images/deloitte/rainman_echo_flag.png "Escape Character + Stack Placement").

However, the manual approaches can take forever and not always bare any fruit, instead we can script it using python and [Pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools).
![Rainmans Echo Script](/images/deloitte/rainman_script.png "PwnTools Script for Format String Vulnerability")

Running this script will produce the flag much faster and has a lot more efficiency. In addition when outputting particular addresses manually will drop the connection to the machine. The script will automatically connect back and continue where it left off, this reduces tedious task of manually reconnecting.

![Rainmans Echo Script Output](/images/deloitte/rainman_script_output.png "Rainmans Echo Script Output")

### Conclusion
Overall the first part of rainmans echo was extremely fun, however we as a team didn't manage to get the flag (although being a few iterations away manually) during the time frame. The personal urge to finish this part of the challenge though made me go back and script the connections and produce the output that we needed. This challenge has shown me I need to spend more time on these challenges and also spend more time with Pwntools, python and exploitation vectors as it shows I an rusty within the area.

## Secure Key Cryptography
Secure key cryptography was the aim of reversing and XOR of a particular encrypted file back, with the intention of reading the contents a.k.a the flag. The challenge provides the encrypted file and the python script which is used to preform the encryption (XOR). 

![Secure Key Cryptography Challenge](/images/deloitte/crypto_challenge.png "Secure Key Cryptography Challenge")

After downloading the two files and knowing that we are working with a 26 byte key we have all the core information needed for this challenge. We can analyse the python file and see that we just need to modify the code to encorporate the key and switch the file paths around (additionally we also need to comment out the import key from key as this isn't needed).

![Secure Key Cryptography Base Python Script](/images/deloitte/crypto_basecode.png "Secure Key Cryptography Basecode")

Going off the idea we need the first 26 bytes of a file to get the header of the file for the key. Using google and the search term "Symantec_Wise_Installer_log_file" the link for ![Symantec Wise](https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html). 

![Symantec Wise Header Website](/images/deloitte/crypto_website.png "Website Header")

This shows that the header is always "***  Installation Started". Using this as an inital key we can run the python script, this will create a Symantec_Wise_Installer_log_file.log file.

![Cryptography .log file](/images/deloitte/crypto_initial_run.png "Python script inital run")

Once we have this file we can use the tool "xxd" on the file to show the hex of the file and its contents. Here we can take the first 26 bytes, as the key is 26 bytes in length.

![Secure Key Cryptography xxd](/images/deloitte/crypto_inital_run_hex.png "XXD on .log")

Taking the first 26 bytes of the file header and then importing them into python and commenting out the previous key variable the python script should look similar to the below screenshot.

![Secure Key Cryptography Key Final](/images/deloitte/crypto_final_code.png "Cryptography Final Code")

Running the python script again and cat the .log file will present you with the flag.

![Secure Key Cryptography Flag](/images/deloitte/crypto_flag.png "Cryptography Flag")

### Conclusion
This challenge was an interesting one and required some googling to peace together, it demonstrates the importance of little bits of information pieced togeteher can provide a huge result in this case the flag.

## Capibara Mail
Capibara Mail is a web based challenge which involves a PHP email service.

![Capibara Mail](/images/deloitte/capibara_challenge.png "Capibara Challenge")

Opening the web instance, presents a web page with a Message header and Message body.

![Capibara Mail Front Page](/images/deloitte/capibara_frontpage.png "Capibara Front Page")

Looking through the source code, a debug statement was left in by the developers (obviously this is a partial clue) as well as an indication of PHP mailer being used.

![Capibara Mail Source Code](/images/deloitte/capibara_debug.png "Debug Statement in Source Code")

Using google with all this information together pointed to a blog post in regards to [PHP Mailer Remote Code Execution](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html). The blog post demonstrates that the -f statement is the entry point of the exploit. Using the sample POC we can test to see if the instance is vulnerable we can generate a string to form the below parameters.

![PoC Exploit](/images/deloitte/capibara_poc.png "PoC Capibara")

Entering test data into both message header and body and then capturing the packets through a proxy using [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp) in this case we can modify the GET parameters as shown in the image below.

![Capibara PoC Exploit](/images/deloitte/capibara_poc_exploit.png "PoC Exploit Capibara")

If the PoC Exploit is successful, we should be able to traverse to phpinfo.php in our browser and be presented with the PHP info page.

![Capibara PHP Information](/images/deloitte/capibara_php_info.png "PHP Info Capibara")

This has confirmed out PoC exploit works, now let us pop dem shellz! Modifying the exploit in the GET request to enable php CMD we can craft a payload which we can interact with and gather a potential flag (or some hashes ofc).

![Capibara PHP CMD](/images/deloitte/capibara_cmd_shell.png "PHP CMD Shell Capibara")

After sending the crafted packet, we can try to traverse the web page again and with some success we have a PHP shell. We can now begin to send commands such as ls into the URL (this CMD is treated like a Linux Terminal), which will print out the flag.php file which means we have completed the challenge!

![Capibara Flag](/images/deloitte/capibara_flag.png "Capibara Flag")

### Conclusion
All credit goes to FluffyDaemon for this once! Reviewing the challenge shows that exploitation in web is still an extremely fun area of work and can provide significant results through manual analysis as well as some research with google.


# Experience
The games began at the bright and early time of 8:00, the employed stratergy was to start with the low hanging fruit (in terms of points), the lowest score of points was 100 which were Ping Pong, Secure Key crypto, So Close and GLaDOS chat. 

![Challenges](/images/deloitte/challenges.png "Deloitte UK CTF Qualifier 2018 Challenges")

Going on the assumption that these challenges are 100 points we could build our teams confidence up and get the ball rolling. The first flag we manage to get was So Close, as a team we began to get into the mind set of how the challenges are created (or so we thought). The day progressed at an alarming rate, the next flag was Ping Pong. The ping pong challenge was glaringly obvious after making the contention between the packet headers and packet contents and thus got us the flag. After Ping Pong we spent time on the Secure Key Crypto, which was a few minutes of googling to find the header and then cracking out python to run through the XOR nowing that the key is 26 bytes and the first 26 bytes of the header are always the same.

As the day came to a close and sitting at 9th place (one place away from the finals) we all grouped together to push for the last few points to push the team to 8th. Thanks to FluffyDaemon for getting the flag for Capibara Mail we hit 8th place with five minutes to spare.

# Conclusion
Hackerzone CTF was an extremely fun CTF but was completly different to other platforms that are public such as HackTheBox, which in turn through us in terms of how we approach each challenge. After some time to think on what we can improve we all agreed we over thought some of the challenges when the answer was pretty much right in front of us.

Now that the CTF has finished and a few days have passed and the thought of the finals has sunk in, we are preparing and practicing for the finals on the 26/02/2018.

Good luck to everyone that is competing and thank you once again to Deloitte for putting on such an event.
