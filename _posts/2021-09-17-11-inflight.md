Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #11**, now halfway into September already! A lot of my happenings recently are longer-term projects, and have been in-flight for weeks. They've also been keeping me much busier than usual.

### What I’ve been up to

September has been keeping me busy in New York City. There were some longer-term projects that I've kickstarted (or resumed) after returning from vacation last month, since I don't anticipate travelling much for the next few months.

*I finished painting a series of miniatures over the past few weekends.* I've accidentally established a tradition to visit game stores while I travel. To support the local business, I typically purchase minis since they can fit in my suitcase. And if I'm not traveling, I go visit local game stores and purchase minis anyway. See the "What I've seen" section for the latest batch of freshly-painted minis!

*I'm 100 hours into my volunteering in the hospital.* It's been a cool experience to learn about how the hospital works, the different staff involved in a hospital (hint: there are a lot of different roles besides a doctor and nurse!), and helping the patients in the capacity that I could. This included restocking the phlebotomy carts, getting supplies for patients, relaying information to staff, and many more. There are times where times were hectic, emotionally difficult, or boring (but hey, I won't complain about the latter). However, this doesn't offset the gratitude, experience, and appreciation for healthcare workers.

*I'm continuing to care for my herb garden sprouts.* The [cilantro](https://www.almanac.com/plant/coriander-and-cilantro) and [sage](https://www.almanac.com/plant/sage) sproutlings have been slowly growing in their own pots. I've been following the advice to water only when the soil feels dry, and to give them plenty of sun. Unfortunately, the oregano didn't root well, and it was blown away from a small gust from my window. This is fortunate because...

*I'm planning to house a cat!* It's been a few years since I've been planning for this, since I needed to find an apartment building that allowed cats. I also waited a couple of months after the start of the pandemic, since there was quite a hype for pet adoptions in NYC. After sorting out apartment shenanigans, such as purchasing cat supplies and cat-proofing areas (i.e. [oregano is poisonous to cats](https://pets.webmd.com/cats/ss/slideshow-foods-your-cat-should-never-eat)), I'm in the process of finding a cat. Don't be surprised to see cat pics in the blog once I adopt a cat!

*I'm planning to write a bigger log about my gap year experience.* While this blog is nice to track my happenings on a bi-weekly cadence, I really wanted to sink my teeth into reflecting the gap year as a whole, and the experiences/knowledge I've gained from it. (If not because otherwise I'll forget what I did beyond the highlights.) Since I'm only around one-third through the gap year, this log will be a living document until early next year. As per the warlock-themed blog, I've named it "Tome of the Gap Year" as a working title.

*Finally, I'm preparing for the CKAD exam scheduled for next week.* I’ve posted [a bonus blog post on CKAD exam prep](https://www.warunlock.com/11-extra-ckad-prep/) last week, since folks asked me for study tips multiple times. As of time of posting, it will be about a week before I take my exam. I've taken a practice exam and got the equivalent of a "B", but I'm still going to review until I feel confident to get that "A".

*But Susanna, there have been other things you've been planning on working on,* you might ask. There are other projects that I dropped due to priority. This month, cat adoption and the CKAD exam will be my focus for this month. Running was something I want to pick up, but the [unusually hotter nights have been problematic](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/upshot/record-breaking-hot-weather-at-night-deaths.html), so I've settled with more walking until later in the year. There are also some shenanigans that I probably forgot to include in this list, or are considered too mundane to include.

And don't worry, I'm kicking my feet onto my coffee table and relaxing as well!

### What I’ve learned

For two blogs posts, I've alluded to [electrical analogies](https://www.warunlock.com/8-into-the-unknown/) and how [the whole concept of electricity has eluded me](https://www.warunlock.com/9-refresh-button/). Well, I finally got to the electricity section of the Physics online course and felt like I got a better grasp of it. While I'm still midway through the section, I can say with confidence that I won't accidentally set things on fire due to poorly-configured circuits!

Electricity is what brought in the modern era as we see today. [Our applilances and technology are powered by this awesome invention.](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/) We can experience it by shocking ourselves on a doorknob after shuffling our feet on a carpet, or by witnessing a lightning strike during a thunderstorm. But how does electricity work?

Before talking about electricity, let's talk about charges. Charges can be positive or negative; unlike charges and like charges repel. These charges boil down to the atomic level. All matter is made up of atoms, which consist of the positively-charged nucleus and negatively-charged electrons buzzing around the nucleus. Despite the amount of charged particles in all matter, most things stay neutrally-charged, since there's so many atoms in matter to balance the charges. However, an object can be [polarized by redistributing the charges](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/estatics/Lesson-1/Polarization).

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog11/charges.jpg" height="350"></div>

<div style="text-align:center"><i>Diagrams of how electric fields are represented by two point charges. Unlike charges attract each other, while like charges repel each other. These electric fields can also push and pull smaller charges.</i></div><br />

Charges aren't always fixed in one spot, but move about freely. The free movement of charges is how electricity works. Why do charges want to move? There's an imbalance of charges, unlike charges really want to come together, and nature likes balance. [With enough charge built up, or with unlike charges at a close enough distance to each other](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/estatics/Lesson-3/Coulomb-s-Law), these unlike charges are compelled to move towards each other. This movement also results in the release of electrical energy.

How much these charges move depend on a variety of factors such as material composition, the amount of a particular charge built up, distance, and temperature.
* Metals, like copper, are found in wires because they're really good conductors of electricity. On an atomic level, the [electrons in metals can freely move around like a "sea of electrons"](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/introchem/chapter/bonding-in-metals-the-electron-sea-model/).
* Other materials, like rubber, are considered insulators because they make movement of charges hard. Air can be considered an insulator - [until thunderstorm clouds build up enough charge to "breakdown" the insulation](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/lightning/faq/) and the air becomes a conductor of electricity.

<div style="text-align:center"><i>A diagram of how lightning strikes happen. The thundercloud has built up charge and becomes polarized. The tree is the tallest object on the ground and becomes polarized. With enough charges built up, the electrons flow through the (now conductive) air and hit the tree as lightning.</i></div><br />

Next blog post, I'll start posting specifically around circuits. There's a lot of different terminology specific to circuits that, while have [analogies to water pipes and fluid dynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_analogy), have some other quirks. (For example, electrical current is defined as the flow of **positive charges**, but in reality, it is the flow of **electrons (negative charge)** that power circuits. However, the [convention stuck prior to the discovery of the latter](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~traylor/ece112/beamer_lectures/elect_flow_vs_conv_I.pdf).) Some questions include:
* What does "1.5V" mean on a battery?
* What happens when a lightbulb on your Christmas lights goes out?
* What is the difference between voltage, current, and charge? And WTF is capacitance, resistance, and other weird terminology?

And for some deeper stuff - [electricity, magnetism, and light all occur due to the same forces of electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism).

### What I’ve seen

Speaking of in-flight projects - one of them was recently completed over the weekend! After purchasing a new set of acrylic paints at a local art store and painting a pair of minis at a time, I was able to finish [a set of dogs ready for adventure](https://steamforged.com/products/dungeons-doggies-volume-3). I swear my painting is marginally better than my photography skills!

### A chapter closed

Thank you for reading this blog post!

Last week, I’ve posted [a bonus blog post on CKAD exam prep](https://www.warunlock.com/11-extra-ckad-prep/) last week. Because the post content goes more in-depth in a topic for a smaller audience, I wanted to separate the content out entirely. To distinguish these bonus blog posts, they will have the words “Deep Lore” in the title. These Deep Lore blog posts will not have a set schedule, and the content will be fairly random. I will include the link to the Deep Lore blog post along the regular email newsletter and blog post.

If you have any other questions, feedback, etc. - don’t hesitate to send an email through [susanna@warunlock.com](mailto:susanna@warunlock.com)!

Please stay safe, and take care!
