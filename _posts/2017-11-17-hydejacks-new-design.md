While v7 brings an [insane amount of new stuff]({{ site.baseurl }}/CHANGELOG/#v700), the most notable change is the new background image.
It is no longer *anti-selling* the theme.
The old image was a blurred version of Napoleon Bonaparte, which was just... weird. I could tell the story of how this came to be,
but I'd rather show you the new and improved background image.

## New background image
Yes, it's an aerial shot of a beach ([so hot right now](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ios+11+background&t=ffab&iax=images&ia=images)).

Q: What has this picture to do with Hydejack?
Nothing really, I just like how it looks.
However: Boat → Pirates → Hijacking → Hydejack (illuminati confirmed)

Even though it is a free image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) (...), it's unique in the sense that
I've modified it so it looks better inside the sidebar.
Specifically, I've straightened out the beach and rotated the boat so that it sits at a nice 90 degree angle.

For comparison, here is the non-euclidean mess the [original photo](https://unsplash.com/photos/AtvuPUenaeI) was. Pretty OCD, I know.

## New color palette
I've extracted the major colors from the background image, which now form Hydejack's color palette:

## New logo
Hydejack also has a new logo, which is based on the new color palette.
It also features the best font on Google Fonts, and probably the world: [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab)
(which is to say, I like it a lot).

[^1]: I should mention that these are only default values. Hydejack let's you choose your own. For inspiration, I've recently added [a gallery]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) to the site that shows a few variations of the theme.
