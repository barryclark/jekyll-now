### Overview

Pieter Cailliau from Redis Labs kicked off our first talk for the evening with Rediscover Redis: Beyond Cache (starting at [27:55](https://youtu.be/uf8PXKOb_gw?t=1675)). He aimed to help us:

* Have basic high-level understanding of Redis.
* Understand why it's so popular and common use cases.
* Know what more you can do with Redis.

Next up Hubert Bosiacki from Suade Labs gave us a great discussion on How to not kubernetes: old habits in a container world  (starting at [1:05:03](https://youtu.be/uf8PXKOb_gw?t=3903)). His takeaways are that:

* Minikube on your machine should not be your final QA test environment.
* Always keep in mind that security should be your priority in development or infrastructure.
* CNCF have awesome frameworks and products from foundation or partners, a simple check might help to find a mature product and avoid a lot of problems.

Finally, after our break we had Prasenjit Sarkar from Oracle discussing Bring your code and not Kubernetes YAML (starting at [1:48:34](https://youtu.be/uf8PXKOb_gw?t=6514)). His takeaways mentioned that:

* Developers tend to focus more on the infrastructure and orchestration complexity and not on their business logic. Just to write a simple web service, and later on deploy it to production, they need to understand Docker image building, Kubernetes concepts, CI/CD platforms, security scanning etc.
* Shipa is a platform that aims to make it easier for developers to run their code in production. Shipa uses the concept of a landing pad, called Pools, to bring application context to your application delivery and management workflow. Pools are where your CI/CD pipeline will deliver the application code and where the process starts with Shipa.
* Once code is received, Shipa pools are responsible for creating the application objects across the multiple OKE clusters, run security scans, attach policies, resource limits, etc.

In place of our usual group photo at our in-person meetups, I also took a quick photo of everyone joining us on Zoom before we closed for the night.
