title:  "Zima Blue Philosophy: Purpose of Universe"
---

Zima Blue is a character from the [Love Death + Robots S1E14](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788510/). The episode shows a  renowned artist Zima reflecting on his mysterious past and the rise into the spotlight before revealing his final piece.

"For Zima, the blue in his murals was his true calling. His purpose that once was. Why he had been created. He simply goes back to his beginning and embraces his truth."

Here is an excerpt: "Humans seek the purpose of their existence, and everything we set out to conquer in this search is outward. 
However, we end up looking for the wrong things – riches, power, status, etc. 
If we started looking inward, we’d begin to realize that happiness is extracted from the simple things we do and feel. From the people in our lives. 
What one has, even if it is mundane, might be far more meaningful than the seemingly majestic options. 
One might be happier embracing their true self rather than creating a falsified outward appearance to seem more impressive. 

> *"The purpose of our existence is merely to be a harmonious part of our ecosystem which in turn is a part of the universe."*

The quest for wealth and power would never complete that quest for happiness."

Fundamentally, I feel their is no meaning of life, and we fill in the meaning ourself. But this framework appeals in a lot of aspects.

Here is something nice I found today:
