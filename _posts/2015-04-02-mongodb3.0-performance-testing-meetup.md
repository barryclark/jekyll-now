On March 24th 2015 I presented to the [Austin MongoDB](http://www.meetup.com/Austin-MongoDB-User-Group/events/220142628/) user group. I had a blast, but I think what really made is so fun is that I am very excited about MongoDB 3.0 and Wired Tiger. It was awesome to share some of the testing, research, and benchmarks I have done. It was a great group and they had good questions. I plan to keep testing and understanding 3.0 and will share more as I go along. Here is a link to the [slides](https://github.com/kgorman/presentations/blob/master/2015/MongoDB3.0_wired_tiger_and_the_era_of_pluggable_storage_engines/MongoDB3.0_wired_tiger_storage_engine.pdf).
