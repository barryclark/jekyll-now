Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #16**! Welcome to the new year of 2022, where I’ve been… staying at home, social distancing and keeping warm. But I’ve made excuses to endure the chilly New York winter for some treats, such as doughnuts or a peppermint mocha, and then come home to a cozy cat.

### What I’ve been up to

Since I’ve visited my parents for Thanksgiving, I spent Christmas and New Years in NYC cooking up a hearty feast. Unfortunately, Monty the cat played around with the lights, so I decided not to set up a Christmas tree this year. However, there were some cool light setups from neighboring buildings!

Due to the COVID-19 spike, some of my planned events were cancelled, and I opted for exploring local spots within Brooklyn. I try to support local restaurants and get some walking in by ordering takeout - and I have to walk fast before the food gets too cold! I’ve also binged some shows (including Game of Thrones!) and slowly trudged through a game involving fantasy adventures and managing a kingdom. The cat keeps me company in the meanwhile, but he does stalk me and give death stares right before dinnertime.

I also needed to fix some of my electronics. My laptop of 5 years was converted into a PC tower because the foldable screen no longer became foldable. I finally got around to disconnecting and removing the top half of the laptop, then put together an external computer monitor and keyboard.

My smartphone also went through an incident in the subway, resulting in a cracked screen. I decided to try my hand on fixing my phone screen myself. I ordered a kit for the replacement parts and… well, I got the phone fixed, but with no sound. Turns out the sound chip was a thin chip embedded within the case, and I couldn’t get the chip out without breaking it. I decided to turn the downturn into a fun trip to my mobile carrier store, as well as pick up some local takeout.

Lastly, I’ve planned some goals for the year. Of course, getting a job will be one of those goals. :-)
