So my fianc&eacute;e likes to do 5K's occasionally. I like to walk but... not run. So we did this today and here are my results:

Tabulated from my app:

The total distance - 3.84 miles is a little more than the normal distance for a 5k - [3.1 miles](https://www.google.com/?searchl#q=5+kilometers+to+miles).

This is for two reasons:

1. I started the app before the starting line.
2. I took a wrong turn during the 5k :(

[The results website](http://www.speedy-feet.com/races/2016/0326/hop-ov.htm) said I did 59:55.8 in 99th place. My fianc&eacute;e did better - 49:39.3 in 88th place.
