## Lato – A Sans Serif Typeface Family

[<dfn>Lato</dfn>][4] is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic. »Lato« means »Summer« in Polish. In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google. 

> <span class="teaser">I do not think of type as something that should be readable. It should be beautiful.</span><cite>[Ed Benguiat][3]</cite>

In the last ten or so years, during which Łukasz has been designing type, most of his projects were rooted in a particular design task that he needed to solve. With Lato, it was no different. Originally, the family was conceived as a set of corporate fonts for a large client — who in the end decided to go in different stylistic direction, so the family became available for a public release.

When working on Lato, Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same time, he created a sleek sans serif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in 2010 — even though it does not follow any current trend.

The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. “Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,” says Łukasz. Learn more at [www.latofonts.com][6]


## About Volkhov &lt;h2&gt; 

<dfn>Volkhov</dfn> is a low-contrast seriffed typeface with a robust character, intended for providing a motivating reading experience. Volkhov was designed by Ivan Petrov.

### Feeling Responsive uses Volkhov for...  &lt;h3&gt;

#### Heading in Volkhov &lt;h4&gt;

As a four-weight family it is well-suited for complex text environments being economic and legible, contemporary and prominent. Many of its design solutions relate to this purpose: large open counters, rather short descenders, and brutal asymmetric serifs.

##### Heading in Volkhov &lt;h5&gt;

Spacing in Bold is slightly increased compared to the normal weight, because the bold mass is mostly grown inwards. The Italic has a steep angle and a distinctive calligraphically reminiscent character, as a counterpart to the rigorous Regular.

## Tables

Even tables are responsive thanks to foundation. A table can consist of these elements.

<table>
  <caption>&lt;table&gt; defines an HTML table</caption>
  <colgroup>
    <col span="1" style="width: 15%;"></col>
    <col span="1" style="width: 50%;"></col>
    <col span="1" style="width: 35%;"></col>
  </colgroup>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>HTML Tag</th>
      <th>Defintion</th>
      <th>Style</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;caption&gt;</td>
      <td>defines a table caption</td>
      <td><code>font-weight: bold;</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;colgroup&gt;</td>
      <td>specifies a group of one or more columns in a table for 
formatting. The &lt;colgroup&gt; tag is useful for applying styles to entire columns, instead of repeating the styles for each cell, for each row.</td>
      <td>no styling needed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;col&gt;</td>
      <td>specifies column properties for each column within a `&lt;colgroup&gt;` 
element</td>
      <td>no styling needed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;thead&gt;</td>
      <td>is used to group header content in an HTML table</td>
      <td><code>font-weight: bold;</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;tbody&gt;</td>
      <td>is used to group the body content in an HTML table</td>
      <td>no styling needed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;tr&gt;</td>
      <td>defines a row in an HTML table</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;th&gt;</td>
