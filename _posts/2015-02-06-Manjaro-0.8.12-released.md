title: Manjaro 0.8.12 released

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/manjaro-0.8.12-xfce.jpg">

We're happy to announce the **0.8.12 release** of Manjaro Linux installation media, including images for the Xfce and KDE4 desktop environments, and our minimal 'Net' edition.

Great progress is being made with our new 0.9 series installation media that uses the Calamares installer, along with our new KDE Plasma 5 installation media, but since neither is quite ready yet we're providing updated 0.8 series installation media that uses our legacy installer, Thus.

This release is **predominantly a maintenance release** and includes very few changes to system defaults relative to the previous 0.8.11 ISOs, with some notable exceptions, such as out-of-the-box support for the exFAT file system and the change to pacman 4.2. Otherwise all the usual upstream updates are included, along with the latest from the Xfce 4.11 development series and the KDE 4.14 series.

Some of our community and OpenRC installation medias will likely also receive updated 0.8.12 releases in the near future.

We hope you enjoy this release.

Kind regards,
The Manjaro Team.
