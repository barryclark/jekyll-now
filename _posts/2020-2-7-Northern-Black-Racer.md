title: January 24, 2020 Snakes at the Virginia Winter Wildlife Festival
---

On January 26, 2020 Susan and I headed to the Virginia Beach for their Winter Wildlife Festival. We met some friends there and made the most of our long weekend. Friday we went on a bird walk and our group spotted a black snake. I later learned that the correct name is a Northern Black Racer, _Coluber constrictor constrictor_. ![image](https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/60344963/large.jpeg?1580086959) It was right along the trail so I was able to kneel down and get a low angle shot while still giving the snake room. It was alert from having our group disturb it from its spot. My photo was lucky to win a prize at the festival and is highlighted on their [website](https://www.vbgov.com/government/departments/parks-recreation/special-events/Pages/winter-wildlife-festival.aspx) currently. Last year a photo I took of a Long-tailed Duck received honorable mention at the festival.

We also saw two Cottonmouth Snakes, -Agkistrodon piscivorus-, the next day – that was the first I had ever seen them. They were quite large.![image](https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/60344703/original.jpeg?1580086703) 

We also saw plenty of birds, as well as a breaching Humpback Whale.
