Every day at the train station I've been walking past the poster for [Green Man](http://www.greenman.net) festival and it grabs me each time. [YCN](http://www.ycnstudio.com) agency have designed the festival identity for the past couple of years, working with [Colophon Foundry](http://www.colophon-foundry.org) to design the custom typeface and this year drafting in [Nous Vous](http://nousvous.eu) for the illustrations. I love the interactive website, which allows you to scroll in multiple directions to navigate, the punchy graphic symbols and the colour palette, which avoids the overuse of green to deliver an identity that captures the essence of the festival at the same time as delivering something unexpected.
