## Step 1 - Try Codecademy First,
## Then Mix It Up So That Your Brain Doesn’t Get Bored…

If you’re anything like me, you might feel impatient when trying to get past irrelevant information in order to get to the point. I’m a straightforward type of person. So learning something new usually simple for me because I try to find the clearest, most accurate line of learning in order to make the end result optimal. But that’s not the case with programming…

Learning a new language is not like learning how to dribble a basketball. You don’t get to hold the ball in your hand, throw it on the ground, watching it bounce back up and try to grasp the ball again.

Hell No. It’s more like you have to learn how to create the cloth brand of the ball, learn how to create the hundreds of little raised indentations around the globe of the ball in order that result in firm grip while also causing the effectiveness of the bounce rebound, learn how to accurately recognize that gravity definitely plays a role in this event, and then figure out how to repeat the action of dribbling.

That’s a hell of a lot more detail than initially advertised when these online articles telling you that computer programming should be your next career transition.

I started learning through this free website back in 2012, before I knew anything about the world of programming. It taught me the proper way to forge HTML5 and CSS, and then I set out on my own to perform web development operations through my own companies. Then I hit a wall and came back to the learning space (bad life methodologies, but that’s 20/20 hindsight)… And then I continued learning.

** Step 1:
Try supplemental learning, But make sure it’s structured!**

	- www.Codecademy.com can help establish good form with structure and syntax
	- www.Freecodecamp.com will help you build a sweet portfolio
	- www.CodeSchool.com is great for solidifying new concepts
	- www.Treehouse.com has been recommended by many, although I have not tried it myself
    
You will also find some commonly used resources for development...

	- www.StackOverflow.com
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/
	- www.MozillaDeveloperNetwork.com
    
It all depends on how you code.


Taken from the /learnprogramming subreddit user ‘**amerryunbirthday**’…

“If MOOC's are more your style, I definitely recommend Sedgewick (Princeton) and Roughgarden's (Standford) Algorithms courses on Coursera. Sedgewick's course covers more concrete implementation of algorithms in Java while Roughgarden's focuses more on the mathematical analysis of algorithms. Both compliment each other very nicely.”
Sedgewick: https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI
Roughgarden: https://www.coursera.org/course/algo


In my next post, I hope to cover some further resources to help new developers establish themselves.

'Til next time,
