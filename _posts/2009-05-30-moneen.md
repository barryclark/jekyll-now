I was <a href="http://www.ingeardrivers.com/this_close_man.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> close to putting some kind of lyric in the title but I didn&#8217;t. True story!

Anyway, the story at hand is about **Moneen** and their upcoming UK tour. June 22, The Barfly in Camden (London) with **Lights Action**! and **Sharks**. And it&#8217;s a relatively cheap night too, only £7 (~$15). It&#8217;s gonna be grand, hopefully I&#8217;ll finally get to see them play a full, uninterrupted set for once&#8230; In Canada I missed most of their set trying to find my seats, supporting Alexisonfire in Sydney they were plagued by technical difficulties, Soundwave this year I had to miss a bit of them to catch some of the other bands playing and then I missed them play at their sideshow.

Speaking of Soundwave sideshows here&#8217;s a photo of Kenny (singer from Moneen) and I after the Alkaline Trio / Saves The Day / Rival Schools gig at the Manning Bar:

I&#8217;m really not good at this blogging thing, I don&#8217;t think I have made a single post yet that I haven&#8217;t edited at least 2-3 times with changes or more information&#8230; This section is one of those additions, I forgot to mention that the **Glastonbury lineup** was announced the other day and it is AMAZING! Checkout <a href="http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/" target="_blank">the full lineup</a> to see what I&#8217;m talking about, but if you can&#8217;t be bothered (and I don&#8217;t really blame you, truth is this blog is really just for me to look back on in future) here&#8217;s a sample of the awesomeness:  
Bruce Springsteen + The E Street Band  
Blur  
Neil Young  
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds  
The Specials  
Lily Allen  
Spinal Tap  
Kasabian  
Eagles of Death Metal  
Tom Jones  
Bloc Party  
White Lies  
The Prodigy  
Yeah Yeah Yeahs  
Brand New (!!!)  
The Gaslight Anthem  
The Streets  
Cold War Kids  
+ many more you probably don&#8217;t know or care about. But I&#8217;m stoked!

19 Days before I head off.
