Ok, this post is going to be a mess. My sincere apologies. lol. Just puking out everything now and then. 

Trip to Melbourne with Monk TGL 10 - 24  
I really want to write about my recent trip to Melbourne. The Karen community. Refugees. Revolutionists. Civil war. Life abroad. Life back home. Karen language. Youth. Peace. Developed country and developing country. Strength. Unity. Culture. Religion. Human nature. Kindness. Hospitality. 
I should probably separate this into another post if I ever write about the whole trip in details. 

Family. Dad. Mom. Sister. Relatives. Finance. Education. Career. Stability. Settle down. Aging. Responsibilities. 

Finlithack at Phandeeyar 8 - 10 March  
Got to see and listen to many people, and about personal lives of a few. The future of youth. Energy. Environment. Mentor. Senior. Junior. Local tech community. Education. Rural area. Down to earth people. Non profit. Civil acts. Community services. Better community. Anthropology. Got to see amazing staff culture from YOMA and Flymya. I have also been into BOD Tech, Flymya and Get.  
I first heard about Flymya and Get from a friend who used to work there. Then I checked them out, I came across BOD Tech which is working on pretty much every consumer product here in Myanmar. This should also be needed to get separated into a different post. lol. So for the past few months, I was helping out a relative with their hotel business and got to learn a bit about local hotel and tourism industry. A few years back then, I have also heard about those industries from a close friend who I no longer have contact with. Anyway. So I first came across this article, [How This Myanmar Travel Company Went From $0 To $1.5M Revenue In A Year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeescobedo/2017/04/10/how-this-myanmar-travel-company-went-from-0-to-1-5m-revenue-in-a-year/#2c251b6a328d), from Forbes and I was surprised. I have never thought these industries were that huge. I have heard of Airbnb, but didn't know the market size. So I ended digging into all the platforms, Booking.com, Agoda, Expedia, Hotels.com, CTrip(mainly for Chinese travelers). And strangely, most of those platforms, (acquired/partnered/invested) are under two main groups. Priceline Group on one side and Expedia Inc. on the other. And there is Airbnb on its own. It convinces me that Joe and Brian did disrupt this industry. I wondered so many websites and platforms, how do hotels and home owners even manage to keep their rooms and properties updated across platforms. There you go. Channel Managers. I was like wtf. lol. People are just incredibly smart. I guess, back then hotels be like we can get a cracked version of room reservation software in our desktop at the reception. And that was what I expected how it would be like. Hell no. Damn, software is eating the world for sure. So I ended up digging more and saw, Global Distribution System, Travel Management Companies, Property Managers, etc. etc.
So basically, a channel manager synces all your rooms that are listed on the websites like Booking.com. And some are hella expensive and even charge commission per booking too. So you have to share a part of your room rent income to online booking platforms and now all these channel managers like SiteMinder and Nobeds(Probably free I guess), there are also open sourced softwares. Another fact, Flymya acquired this [Switch.cm](https://www.switch.cm). Wait what! A channel Manger for channel managers. So how do I found out Switch.cm? I bluntly asked someone from one of the online booking companies for a local channel manager company suggestion and they recommended me that. No sure they are supposed to say. lol. Bruh! I just checked now and saw. They are also using iosmetric design here in their [Features page](https://www.switch.cm/features). That design trend is LIT. Haha. Here is a Twitter thread about [this design trend](https://twitter.com/jadlimcaco/status/1049761117088563200), a list of company websites using isometric and retro human design. Well I think this is enough. Cramped af in here. I shall write in details later in a different post. I really really wonder where the future is going. How the future of businesses will be like. Here is the progression I see in this one particular industry. Hotels, like real infrastructure, real building. People come to town, ask the locals and then go stay there. Then, the internet and WWW, there are individual website for those hotels. Guests call them on phone or send fax to book. Facebook pages. Then here are these platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, and so on. And again Google and TripAdvisor list prices of a hotel from those booking platforms. For hotels, there are channel managers to manage reservations. Again there are API services for those channel management platforms. So where exactly this is going. (How do we filter all these information to the right user?) There is soon going to be a mixed branch of industries; hotel and tourism, co-working spaces (Sharing Economy), real estate, digital nomads; [Nomad List](https://nomadlist.com/) & [HackerParadise](https://www.hackerparadise.org/), [Tribe Theory](https://tribetheory.com/yangon/) and many are becoming trendy.  
A question I have, so how is the government working on rules and regulations for these disruption so that locals won't get exploited. Or how can locals prepare or adapt to these digital disruption to be able to integrate their businesses. That is the issue I am seeing when I talk to local business owners, they just can't understand why their businesses are not doing good. Blame the governemnt! lol. Not really. Cos the governemnt itself is becoming the victim of this rapid changes. Well, this bascially is a revolution, not cultural or social, but digital. I might probably need to dig into O2O business model to have more opinion on this. 

Ok. ok. Enough of writing. lol. 

I really thank the bro who invited me to the team and other bros who were in the teams. Htet was the best, of course.

This hackathon thing should be written into a separated post. lol. This is becoming a mess. 

I still remember my first Hackathon, probably in 2014-2015 I guess. 

There are a few more topics I want to write about, depression, vegetarianism/veganism, social media. 

So many questions. Thoughts. Retrospections. 

Gradually, everything in the head will fade away as dreams after nights. 

What matters? 
What doesn't? 
Bigger picture. 
Source of issues around the nation. 
Ethnic minorities.

Ah, shoot. I thought those thoughts would fade away like dreams last night. They didn't seem to. Maybe, I didn't get enough sleep. 

The time-machine bubble
I am giving this phenomenon a name, the time-machine bubble effect. lol.

Here is the best possible definition I could come up with: 
A situation where a person who believes they have seen the future or believes they can work on it, is wearing a bubble astronaut helmet. 

Those people cannot easily be distracted from their mission. The bubble is powerful. As if they came back from the future wearing the bubble, they are pretty determined to fix the present issues. I myself was once wearing that bubble. It burst when I hit the wall of reality and that hurts. Now, I desperately need a new bubble. 

Downside. 
Missing out from Reality. Wishful thinking. 
Some people have been to the future. Or some have had the vision of it.

Hackathons
October 23, 2015 
My first hackathon. HackingEDU. I was super excited and couldn't even sleep for like a few days after that. I didn't get to build anything, and I, along with a friend, was in shock to see thousand of coders coding whole nights, some were as young as 13 and some got dropped off by their parents as if it was a playground and only to be picked up after the event. There was Sam Altman and Salma Khan. Many university/college students flew to California from all across the US. Some are high schoolers.  One project I remember was a senior who sat next to us, built an image recognition sensor where the sensor can read the blocks with alphabets; A, B, C, etc. on it and those alphabets represent pieces of programming, like for loops, variables, etc. Basically, like drag and drop programming but with real blocks. Don't remember exactly, wooden or plastic. 

July 15, 2016, AT&T Hacks Oracle Park 

July 23, 2016 
Spectra Hackathon was there as a volunteer, at Youtube Headquarter. https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.545963605614629&type=1&l=6de9864a8e 

Aug 27-28, 2016
Another Hackathon was at Plug and Play center. Since I didn't have any plan on building anything, I just talked to as many people as I can. I got to talk a few students from Singapore, who were doing an internship in the US. And I just talked to a few seniors who were like tech veterans and they explained to me what money laundering is and how it can be prevented using technology. Interesting thing is that tech veterans were also there to join the hackathon. Isn't it an amazing culture?

Sep 10, 2016, TechCrunch Hackathon
It was fun cos we took a break to eat out Tacos with these people.

And there you go, series of VR filming hackathons at 360°ED. At Tamwe Plaza and at Dulwich college. 

June 30- July 1, 2018, AngelHack Yangon 
This was fun too. With interns from Softhatch. 

I have always been wishing it would be cool if we have hackathons here and then more hackathons here. Here they are now. But now I am like screw it. The hackathon is just a hackathon and most products coming out of hackathons are not even going to be kept working on. Hackathon is just a part of marketing strategy for corporate. Of course, who cares, as long as they give out freebies like t-shirts and stickers. 

What the hell, Saw. It is true, most products are not getting built after the hackathons. But there are still many good reasons for hackathons. It is refreshing. It is fun. It brings people together in the community. It encourages newcomers. The product doesn't need to be grand or extravagant, or anything. It can just be anything working, any prototype. Doesn't even have to be an MVP. It could be a presentation. It could be a mockup. It could be just a design or a business plan. Don't stop yourself there, let your imagination flow freely. It brings inspiration. What the fuck is wrong with you Saw. What just happened to you. 
I could see myself with the darkness devouring me slowly, growing skepticism on everything anything. What the hell did I just go through? lol. I thought whatever I went through won't impact me this much. It actually does. Geez. I hate this weird feeling and situation. 

Yes, I admit, I miss all the friends I got separated apart from, those I had to move on cos I no longer had the privilege(lifestyle, living standard), time and resources to stay in touch, those who drifted apart, 

But what can I do? 
There still one dream to meet each and everyone of them again in my life. 

Or probably that is just how life is. Rule number one: Don't ever let your childhood spirit die.
