In this post, I will be discussing Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and how it can be used in datasets to understand variation with many
different variables. Many real-world datasets are often in high
dimensions. In otherwords, they contain so many variables that it is
difficult to distinguish a trend.

PCA is a type of dimensional reduction method that can assist us by
identifying which variables contribute to the variation within the data.
It is similar to fitting a best fit line onto a 2D graph, but in this
case there may be more than three-dimensions of data. It is formulated
in the language of linear algebra and is an often used technique in data
science and bioinformatics.

To get started, make sure you have installed both [R](https://www.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"} and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} in addition to the packages listed below. If you need help getting started with R, I suggest [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r){:target="_blank"} in addition to other resources found online.

    library(ggplot2)
    library(cowplot) # required to arrange multiple plots in a grid

    ## 
    ## ********************************************************

    ## Note: As of version 1.0.0, cowplot does not change the

    ##   default ggplot2 theme anymore. To recover the previous

    ##   behavior, execute:
    ##   theme_set(theme_cowplot())

    ## ********************************************************

    library(dplyr)

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

We will be using the often cited `iris` dataset. As you can see, there
are more than five dimensions of data.

    head(iris)

    ##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
    ## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
    ## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
    ## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
    ## 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
    ## 5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
    ## 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa

Let us try to observe some patterns with different combinations of
variables.

    p1 <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Species)) + geom_point()
    p2 <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, color=Species)) + geom_point()
    p3 <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, color=Species)) + geom_point()
    p4 <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Width, y=Petal.Width, color=Species)) + geom_point()
    plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, p4, labels = "AUTO")

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PCA_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

As you can see from the graphs, petal length, petal width, and perhaps
sepal length contribute the most to the differences between the three
species.

Let’s try using PCA as a better method for detecting such patterns.
First, we will only include numerical data. We will pass our dataset
(excluding the Species column) into the function `prcomp`. `center` and
`scale` will be set to true to scale the data to 0 mean and unit
variance.

    iris.pca <- prcomp(iris[,1:4], center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)
    summary(iris.pca)

    ## Importance of components:
    ##                           PC1    PC2     PC3     PC4
    ## Standard deviation     1.7084 0.9560 0.38309 0.14393
    ## Proportion of Variance 0.7296 0.2285 0.03669 0.00518
    ## Cumulative Proportion  0.7296 0.9581 0.99482 1.00000

The main results are that Principal Components 1 and 2 explains the
majority of the variance within the dataset. These values are derived
from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues from the covariance matrix.

To better understand, you will need a basic understanding of
eigenvectors and eigenvalues. To simply put, an eigenvector is a vector
whose direction remains unchanged after a linear transformation. In that
regard, an eigenvector provides direction or orientation of the data,
like 90 or 45 degrees. The change after a linear transformation is
described as the eigenvalue. In other words, the variance or spread of
the data is explained by the eigenvalue. In addition, an *n*-th
dimensional matrix will have the same *n* eigenvectors/eigenvalues.
Therefore, each principal component is an eigenvector and PC1 has the
highest eigenvalue (highest variance).

We can observe the results of the linear transformation with
`iris.pca$x`.

    head(iris.pca$x)

    ##            PC1        PC2         PC3          PC4
    ## [1,] -2.257141 -0.4784238  0.12727962  0.024087508
    ## [2,] -2.074013  0.6718827  0.23382552  0.102662845
    ## [3,] -2.356335  0.3407664 -0.04405390  0.028282305
    ## [4,] -2.291707  0.5953999 -0.09098530 -0.065735340
    ## [5,] -2.381863 -0.6446757 -0.01568565 -0.035802870
    ## [6,] -2.068701 -1.4842053 -0.02687825  0.006586116

Let’s add back in the species data.

    pca_data <- data.frame(iris.pca$x, Species=iris$Species)
    head(pca_data)

    ##         PC1        PC2         PC3          PC4 Species
    ## 1 -2.257141 -0.4784238  0.12727962  0.024087508  setosa
    ## 2 -2.074013  0.6718827  0.23382552  0.102662845  setosa
    ## 3 -2.356335  0.3407664 -0.04405390  0.028282305  setosa
    ## 4 -2.291707  0.5953999 -0.09098530 -0.065735340  setosa
    ## 5 -2.381863 -0.6446757 -0.01568565 -0.035802870  setosa
    ## 6 -2.068701 -1.4842053 -0.02687825  0.006586116  setosa

Next, we will plot the first two principal components as these would
explain the highest variation within the data.

    ggplot(pca_data, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=Species)) + geom_point()

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PCA_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

We can observe that setosa separates further from versicolor and
virginica. To understand which variables contribute to this variation in
the data, we will call `iris.pca$rotation`.

    iris.pca$rotation

    ##                     PC1         PC2        PC3        PC4
    ## Sepal.Length  0.5210659 -0.37741762  0.7195664  0.2612863
    ## Sepal.Width  -0.2693474 -0.92329566 -0.2443818 -0.1235096
    ## Petal.Length  0.5804131 -0.02449161 -0.1421264 -0.8014492
    ## Petal.Width   0.5648565 -0.06694199 -0.6342727  0.5235971

Here we can see that `Sepal.Length`, `Petal.Length`, and `Petal.Width`
contributes quite a bit to PC1 compared to `Sepal.Width`. However,
Sepal.Width contributes greatly to PC2.

Therefore, based on the above graph, we can infer that variance in the
x-axis is due to `Sepal.Length`, `Petal.Length`, and `Petal.Width` and
variance in the y-axis is due to `Sepal.Width`. Running the following
code will show this concept as vectors.

    # capture the rotation matrix in a data frame
    rotation_data <- data.frame(iris.pca$rotation, variable=row.names(iris.pca$rotation))
    # define a pleasing arrow style
    arrow_style <- arrow(length = unit(0.05, "inches"),
                         type = "closed")
    # now plot, using geom_segment() for arrows and geom_text for labels
    ggplot(rotation_data) + 
      geom_segment(aes(xend=PC1, yend=PC2), x=0, y=0, arrow=arrow_style) + 
      geom_text(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=variable), hjust=0, size=3, color='blue') + 
      xlim(-1.,1.25) + 
      ylim(-1.,1.) +
      coord_fixed() # fix aspect ratio to 1:1

As you can see, before performing a PCA, we used four graphs to observe
the conclusion that petal length, petal width, and sepal length
contributed the most to the variance in species. With PCA, we could
easily observe this with the PCA plot of PC1 vs PC2. In addition, we
used a simple dataset to illustrate this. Many real-world datasets
consists of much higher dimensions.
