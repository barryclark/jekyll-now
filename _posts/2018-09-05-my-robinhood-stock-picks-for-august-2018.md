August is now over, and it's time to see how my progress has been on Robinhood.

## How I Choose

To recap, here's how I choose what stocks to buy:

* Stock price must be affordable - under $100, maybe even under $50. This is because Robinhood currently does not support buying fractional shares.
* The company must be a company I believe in - in terms of growth, ethics, technology, innovation, etc. So, no Wal-Mart, no tobacco companies, etc.
* There is a slight preference to companies I use.

## Progress

How have I been doing? Well, I've invested $392.97 via Robinhood, and my balance as of August 31 is $393.21. That's up - a whopping 24&cent; - , and up is good, but once you take out my bonus free stock (CHK), valued at $4.43 also on August 31, my balance is actually down about four bucks  ($393.21 - $4.43 = $388.78; $388.78 - $392.97 = -$4.

## My Picks

The stocks I bought in August are:

* Wendy's
* Aramark
* Canadian Solar
* HP (Hewlett-Packard)
* Honda
* Nintendo

I like Wendy's. I also like McDonald's, but Wendy's stock is much more affordable than McDonald's.

Aramark is very much a behind-the-scenes company. However, they provide the food and other supplies a lot of smaller, local restaurants use, as well as schools, hospitals, stadiums, etc.

I profited a bit via Canadian Solar via options (see [losing money with options](#losing-money-with-options) below), and have also wanted to invest in some solar companies. This may not have been the best buy with [Trump's solar tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-solar-insight/billions-in-u-s-solar-projects-shelved-after-trump-panel-tariff-idUSKCN1J30CT), but I'm investing long term. Trump won't be President forever, and I doubt these tariffs are forever, either.

Honda is the third automotive company stock I've bought, after GM and Ford. My wife drives a Honda - she comes from a "Honda family" - although they seem to be getting into Toyota Priuses recently. Also, I used to drive a Honda, and they are good cars. On the negative side, however, it might not be a great idea to be so heavily invested in the automotive industry right now, since it's future is more uncertain than ever.

Finally, Nintendo. I have a lot of fond memories of playing the Nintendo, Super Nintendo, and Nintendo 64. Also, despite Nintendo being almost completely an electronic entertainment company, they're actually rather old - they were founded in 1889. When [Robinhood they announced the ability to purchase global stocks that are not on US exchanges](http://blog.robinhood.com/news/2018/8/27/introducing-global-stocks-on-robinhood), I jumped on the change to buy a piece of Nintendo.

## Dividends!

I received $0.59 from my single share of Verizon. Not too exciting, but it is my biggest dividend payout to date (on Robinhood, that is).

## Losing Money with Options

I've also started playing with options. I'm starting small - right now, I'm trying to learn. Making money comes later.

The first option I successfully bought was Canadian Solar (CSIQ). I bought a $14.50 call for $10. A few days later CSIQ looked to be doing good - the same $14.50 call was going for $40. I should have sold, because then CSIQ shares dropped in price, and so did the value of the call. I sold the call for $20 - ten dollars in profit - before it expired. I do believe it ended up expiring worthless.

Since a CSIQ option made me some money, I bought a share of CSIQ. I also bought another CSIQ option (this time a $15.50 call), but the price never went that high, I couldn't sell it, and so it expired worthless.

I bought a few more options that ended up expiring worthless. Here's the complete list of options I bought in August on Robinhood that ended up expiring worthless:

* GME Put $14 8/10
* CSIQ Call $15.50 8/17
* F $9.50 Put 8/24
* F $10.00 Call 8/24

In total, I spent $15 on these options and lost it all (just like buying a lottery ticket, I suppose).

You may notice that I bought both a put and a call for Ford (F) that expired on 8/24. That's because I thought it was highly unlikely that Ford would end up between $9.50 and $10.00. But it did, and I lost money.

Somehow, though, I still have more money in my Robinhood account than I've put in, so if I just look at my account balance, it doesn't look as if I've lost money.

## Remember!

This money is money I can afford to lose - when I buy any stocks or options, I automatically assume a complete loss, at least as far as my budget goes.
