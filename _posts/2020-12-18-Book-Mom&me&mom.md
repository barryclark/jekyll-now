title: Angelou's Mom&Me&Mom
---
I read this book in February 2017, and since then, it has been my favorite. I have reread it multiple times now, and I remember the emotional rollercoaster I had experienced with this book. It was hard to keep this book down. This book really made me steal time to get on reading!

This memoir does not center on Angelou's childhood but rather constructs a portrait of self via details of her relationship to the mother who abandoned her and with whom she reunited as a teenager. 

Vivian Baxter’s marriage broke apart when Angelou was three and her brother, Bailey, was five. Admitting that she was neither prepared or suited for parenthood, Baxter dispatched her California-raised children to her mother-in-law in Stamps, Arkansas, where they remained for a decade. 

Aged 13, Angelou and her brother were sent to live with Vivian. In  Arkansas, they had been poor and rural children, but San Francisco was to prove glamorous. The transition wasn't easy. Vivan Baxter, a formidable woman who ran gambling houses, was also "difficult to resist," possessed of a strange charm that made folks adore her as well as fear her. Angelou didn't feel she can call her mom or mother. Angelou described Lady as a "startling beauty," a woman "too mean to lie" and a force to be reckoned with. She chose instead the name Lady for her. "Because," Angelou says, "you are so beautiful, and you don't look like a mother." Vivian goes with her daughter's choice and starts introducing herself to friends and family as Lady Baxter. Yet, Angelou soon starts to discover motherly qualities in Lady.

Angelou decides she wants to work on the streetcars as a conductor. She hadn't considered that only white people did the job. When she comes back dejected and rejected, Lady Baxter tells her, "Go get it" and she goes back to the office every day for two weeks until they gave her the job becoming the first African-American woman to work on the local railroad. With few more pages, we find that every morning, Lady got in her car with her pistol beside her on the seat and followed the streetcar to check her daughter was safe.

Later, when Angelou found herself pregnant out-of-wedlock at the age of 17, again, Lady pushed her through it. Lady has just one question for her, does she love the father? When the answer is no, she says: "We, you and I, are going to have a wonderful baby." Lady, a trained nurse, then prepares her young daughter to give birth, telling her jokes to get her through the labour. It's after this that she finds herself calling Lady mother. “The baby had not been planned and I would have to rethink plans about education, but to Vivian Baxter that was life being life. Having a baby while I was unmarried had not been wrong. It was simply slightly inconvenient.”

<blockquote style="color:grey;font-size:17px;">
When her mother lay dying of lung cancer, poet Maya Angelou took her hand and kissed her fingers. She said: "You've been a hard worker... You have been a ship fitter, a nurse, a real estate broker and a barber... You were a terrible mother of small children but there has never been anyone greater than you as a mother of a young adult."

Few of my favourite lines from this read.

<ul>
<li> “Independence is a heady draft, and if you drink it in your youth, it can have the same effect on the brain as young wine does. It does not matter that its taste is not always appealing. It is addictive and with each drink you want more.” </li>

<li> “Love heals. Heals and liberates. I use the word love, not meaning sentimentality, but a condition so strong that it may be that which holds the stars in their heavenly positions and that which causes the blood to flow orderly in our veins.”</li>

<li> “Don't do anything that you think is wrong. Just do what you think is right, and then be ready to back it up even with your life.”</li>

<li> “I really saw clearly, and for the first time, why a mother is really important. Not just because she feeds and also loves and cuddles and even mollycoddles a child, but because in an interesting and maybe an eerie and unworldly way, she stands in the gap. She stands between the unknown and the known.”</li>

<li> “Go," she whispered. "Go. Show them you spell your name W-O-M-A-N.”</li>

<li> “You see, baby, you have to protect yourself. If you don’t protect yourself, you look like a fool asking somebody else to protect you.” I thought about that for a second. She was right. A woman needs to support herself before she asks anyone else to support her.”</li>
</ul>
