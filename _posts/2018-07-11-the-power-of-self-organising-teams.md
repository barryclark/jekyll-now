Here at CarFinance 247 our development team have always claimed to work using Agile methodologies, as all modern technology teams do! However, when looking back at some of our past missions (see previous post – [How to facilitate engineering engagement and team discussions(/how-to-facilitate-engineering-engagement-and-team-discussions/)), it was clear that we adhered to some of the 12 Agile principles more than others, and ignored some altogether.

We excel at Principle 4, ensuring that business people and developers work together closely throughout the project. We are involving stakeholders and SME's throughout the journey, they attend our daily stand-ups and sprint planning. This ensures everyone involved understands what we are working on, and enables an open forum for any requirement changes that may arise throughout the mission. As with any business, we have areas we can improve on; our main focus recently has been on ensuring we release value early and continuously (Agile Principles 1 and 12). On previous projects we may have had a single deployment throughout an entire project (2 if we were really lucky!). In hindsight, a final show and tell to senior management before we were allowed to release any code, was a clear symptom of our 'un-agileness'.

So when we started to think about planning our next mission, a team of us discussed what we could do differently on this mission in order to make sure we did not fall down the same pitfalls as before, paying particular attention to Principles 1 and 12.

We asked ourselves what the benefits were from plan driven vs value driven planning. With plan-driven planning, which is predominately how we worked in the past, the developers and product manager would sit down at the beginning of a project and write hundreds of user stories and tasks down. We'd then estimate them, epic them and off we'd go to build a new product or feature. Once everything had been completed we release. When it came to our product releases, we were 100% waterfall rather than being agile (like we claimed). This made us ask the question: was value driven planning the way forward for us?

Our Head of Engineering, Andrew Kuzsyk, came up with a great activity for the next mission planning to incorporate value driven planning. This was the "Fishbone" exercise, in which the each bone of the fish signalled a 2 week sprint. It works by everybody in turn placing a task on the fishbone time line which can be moved at any point by another member. The task that you place on a bone, along with any other tasks, should be completable in that 2 week sprint. At the same time, focus should always be on the priority of the tasks to ensure that we are adding value early on. 

When we carried out this activity in our mission planning, there were lots of 'healthy' debates on what the priorities were:
>We should do the agent profiles first as that is what this mission is about

>Well it doesn't make sense to release agent profiles if we don't have any reviews to publish on the profiles

>We can't publish profiles without moderating the reviews first

>In order to store the reviews with need to create a database to store them

>But in order to make any of these requests we need an API

It probably took us about 1 hour 30 mins to all finally agree on what our release plan should look like and to get to a point where we were comfortable that we were being realistic with what we were trying to achieve within each 2 week sprint.

We had our mission. We had our release plan. We were going to be releasing value early and regularly (at the end of every sprint in fact!). We felt like we were on to a winner here!

A major benefit of planning out mission work in this way is that it is very easy to see whether you are on track, behind or - best case scenario - ahead of where you wanted to be. It's simple; you have either released the work or you haven't. 

Another advantage to planning in this way is it also enables you to fail fast and learn quickly; you are incrementally releasing smaller amounts of code, which makes it easier to identify what could be causing an issue and to resolve it sooner.

Now, this particular mission is not over yet. However early insights are all very positive. The mission is ahead of schedule (this never happens!) and we have made amendments to the release plan along the way, based on our previous deployments. The team have really embraced this change, and are much more engaged in the project. We have been adding value constantly, rather than in one “big bang” so there's no fear around releases from stakeholder and developer alike. All in all I am one happy product manager thus far, thanks value driven planning!
