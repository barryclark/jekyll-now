# Javascript Styles

---

- **2 spaces** – for indentation
- **No unused variables** – this one catches tons of bugs!
- **No semicolons** – It's fine. Really!
- Never start a line with `(` , `[` , or `````
    - This is the only gotcha with omitting semicolons – automatically checked for you!

- **Space after keywords** `if (condition) { ... }`
- Always use `===` instead of `==` – but `obj == null` is allowed to check `null || undefined` .

# Usage

The easiest way to use JavaScript Standard Style to check your code is to install it globally as a Node command line program. To do so, simply run the following command in your terminal (flag `-g` installs standard globally on your system, omit it if you want to install in the current working directory):

    npm install standard -g

After you've done that you should be able to use the `standard` program. The simplest use case would be checking the style of all JavaScript files in the current working directory:

    $ standard
    Error: Use JavaScript Standard Style
     lib/torrent.js:950:11: Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.
