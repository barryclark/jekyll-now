I'm releasing a piano suite, **Bridge of Reflections**, as **Taylor J Hawkins**, on **June 1st, 2023**. 
It will be available on Spotify, ITunes, and other digital distribution platforms. 
The material was composed this year (2023), with [Musescore](https://musescore.org/) and [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), my current DAW, in my home studio.

The intention of this suite was to experiment with dynamics with limited timbric expression, thus the choice of two pianos. It also served as a continued refinement of my compositional workflow. 

The album cover was photographed by my good friend, [Derek Rathke](https://derekrathke.com/), at Cathedral Park and features the oft forgotten Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 5.1 in the background. 
The scores will also be available for purchase at [Sheet Music Plus](https://www.sheetmusicplus.com/) and [Sheet Music Direct](https://www.sheetmusicdirect.com/) thanks to [ArrangeMe](https://www.arrangeme.com/about).

**Movements:**  
- Movement 1 - Moderato
- Movement 2 - Andante
- Movement 3 - Allegro
