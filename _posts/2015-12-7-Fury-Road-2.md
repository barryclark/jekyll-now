 If you don't understand anything of what I'm talking, I suggest to read the previous entry [FURY ROAD I](http://dactrtr.rocks/Fury-Road/), If you still don't understand, sorry my english it no so goo.

**Christchurch** *the land of the eternal and really well paid jobs that everyone has except of you*, again 2/3 of the party has been already here in the past, and was our next stop after ending the **Fury Road Trip**, anyway guess who was that 1/3...

Akaroa was more fun, especially cuz *Jeremy* was in a explosion of *french Emotions*, Akaroa is one of the First, or maybe the only, french Community and everything is writted in french, and it's full of *french flags* of course I wish there were more **french girls** than flags, but life it's sad sometimes.
*more about Akaroa in it's own post*

### Dunedin


**STOP EVERYTHING** If you have speaked with me you should remember that I'm the less *my country is better than yours* in this universe, but, **pls common** what's that shit about the **steppest road in the universe** in **Dunedin**, srsly where I was living in **Reñaca** I have to *climb* a steppest road than this one, and I also run the damn thing to get tho class at time (that's the main reason why I fucked up my knees). I'm tired of your shit **Dunedin** get your shit together, *shualo*. **Kisses to all the ppl in Dunedin**

The town of the **Steampunk**, if you love the **Steampunk** life you will love this place, if not, well yo can skip this town, there's also a **Steampunk museum**. Did I say the **Steampunk** word enough times.

*The southest south southering southtown in town*, yes it's at the really south, and that's all, I even think there's no people in this place, well if the *luck* it's with you, maybe the **Aurora Australis** will appear in front of you, if not, you can go to this **amazing space bathroom** where you only have ten minutes to *drop the mole*.

### Fiordland

The only thing to tell of this place, besides *it's beautiful bla bla bla* it's that at this point we ditched the old and comfy tent for **2 persons** for a luxury **4 persons** tent, so we set up the tent, get comfy, good night fellas...
> What time is it?

Jèrèmy


Yes we are ready to sleep at **4PM**, so this was the **longest night of our lives**, also one of the coldest night ever, and we know that, cuz **Jèrèmy** was slowly during the night coming from his side to **MY SIDE**, passing through **Jure Side** so at morning we are at the same space that in the old *notsocomfytent*.

and that's all of our... **NO** surprise at the next morning when we try to get into the car, **SURPRISE** the car was [FROZEN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU), so the longest night get more longer...

The car get also stuck in the mud, twice, and well I fell in the mud, but with the help of some **French** dudes, we can go away and went to the last spot...

### Queenstown

Look there's a **Foursquare** in Queenstown and it's **Fucking** **expensive**, also a lot of **expensive** stuff to do.
**E X P E N S I V E**.

Next stop... Christchurch but there will be no post for that, because **AKAROA ROCKS**.
