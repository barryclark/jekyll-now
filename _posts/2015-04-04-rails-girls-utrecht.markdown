Last Saturday I joined [Rails Girls Utrecht](http://railsgirls.com/utrecht). It was my first experience coaching and I really enjoyed it. I learned a lot from the attendees and it was wonderful to see so many women interested in coding. Thank you [@RailsGirls_UT](https://twitter.com/RailsGirls_UT) for giving me this opportunity!

You can check the [storify](https://storify.com/RailsGirls_UT/rails-girls-utrecht) for all the tweets (and pictures!) and [Lieke Boon](https://twitter.com/Lieke2208) also wrote a small [recap](http://codepancake.com/it-really-happened-rails-girls-utrecht/) of the event.

During the event I shared my story with them about how I landed a job in tech a couple of years ago. Here you can check out the [slides](http://www.miriamtocino.com/projects/from_architect_to_full_time_developer.pdf). I got lots of questions and some of the girls turned out to be very inspired and interested in giving coding a try. That made me very happy!

Interested in joining us next time? What about passing by [the next meetup](http://www.meetup.com/RailsGirls-NL/events/197906272/) on the 15th of April?

You still have questions? Get in touch! ☺
