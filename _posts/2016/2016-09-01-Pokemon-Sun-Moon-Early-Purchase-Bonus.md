The Pokémon Company International has announced a special in-game bonus for those who purchase Pokémon Sun or Moon before January 11th, 2017. Early purchasers will recieved a special Munchlax that will evolve into a Pulverizing Snorlax, a power Snorlax that hold *Snorlium Z*, granting it the Pulverizing Pancake Z-Move.

Along with this announcement came the reveal of the Alolan Rattata:

**Alolan Rattata**\\
Type: Dark/Normal

Unlike ordinary Rattata, urban areas are Alolan Rattata’s main habitat. They are nocturnal and live in nests of several dozen. Alolan Rattata have an excellent aptitude for sniffing out delicious fresh foods in Alola. They pay no attention to foods that aren’t fresh. Alolan Raticate serve as their boss.

I continue to look forward to seeing all these new Alolan variations on the original 151, and hope we get more soon!

As usual, I'll post more info as it comes along. Until then you can watch the trailer for the above announcement below:
