**What story does your group tell about your character?**

Back in high school my friends and I played World of Darkness games for a while. Mostly Vampire and Werewolf. While Vampire was our go to game that I usually GM'd, we would sometimes take a night to let one of my other friends GM a Werewolf story. This kid was a great GM, and always made stories interesting with lots of opportunities for us to do cool things. Werewolf was very generous with dice pools when you were in full werewolf form.

I can't remember many of the details about how it was pulled off, but my character found himself locked in a museum and surrounded by mages. While the following battle really wasn't overly special, the flow of the game had our group retelling the story of the mages' demises for weeks after. I can't even take the credit for it. I can't say it was my play choices, roleplaying, or even luck of the die. It was all our GM, and how masterfully he let the situation play out.

In the end it was also the beginning of the end for our werewolf games. It felt like nothing could top the excitement of that entire night's campaign.

It's a shame, really. I remember loving the world of Werewolf.
