Grasshopper Manufacture Inc. has announced that they're remastering SUDA51's debut game, The Silver Chair, in HD, along with localizing the game in English for the first time. The first trailer for the game just hit YouTube, and contains scenes from the game's first chapter, "Decoyman."

The Silver Case is an interactive novel which progresses as the player solves various puzzles. The story revolves around the player, a member of a special forces unit called "Republic," trying to uncover the identity of a serial killer made famous from The Silver Case killings 20 years prior. The killer, known only as Kamui, has resurfaced and must be stopped.

Grasshopper Manufacture has already opened store pages for the game on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/476650) and [PLAYISM](http://playism-games.com/game/285/the-silver-case). It should hit this fall for $14.99. I'll post an in-depth review once I get my hands on it.
