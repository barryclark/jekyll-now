I'm starting to see several video games use the deck-building mechanic now. [Hand of Fate](http://www.purplepawn.com/2014/08/second-lookhand-of-fate/) was a fun distraction for a while, though it's repetative nature got to me after a bit. Now I've gotten a review code for Forced Showdown, a twin-stick, rogue-like game with a deck-building mechanic to it. From what I've seen on their [website](http://forcedshowdown.com/), it seems pretty cool. I'm hoping to get a chance to play it tonight and see for myself. If I do, I'll make sure to stream it on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/rkalajian).

*UPDATE: I got a chance to play and stream! Check it out below.*
