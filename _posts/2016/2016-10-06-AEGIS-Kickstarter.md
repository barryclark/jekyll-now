I had taken a look at an early prototype [A.E.G.I.S.](http://www.purplepawn.com/2014/06/second-looka-e-g-i-s-arc-buster-starter-set/) over at Purple Pawn a few years back while Zephyr Workshop was still working on the game. Now Greenbrier has picked up the game and currently has it up on Kickstarter. It's my first Kickstarter pick for October, and it's a game I'm really excited about. I enjoyed the game when I first tried it and now it looks more polished and perfected.

I don't doubt A.E.G.I.S. will be funded, so make sure you get at least a $40 pledge in for one of two starter sets. The stretch goals are hidden for now, but I'm sure there are more robots, and possibly miniatures, in those somewhere. Unfortunately, the $200 tier is all gone, so if you were looking for a chance to become a permanent part of the Zephyr team you're out of luck.

While I still have the original prototype Zephyr sent me, I should be getting one for the Greenbrier version in the next month or so. Once I do I'll make sure to update my review over on Purple Pawn.
