Hex Casters is one of the first games released by Hasbro that was funded through Indiegogo. It's a party game for 3-6 players where players are trying to hex each other and protect themselves from other players. Hexes are pretty crazy, as you can see in the cards below.

I managed to get a picture of every card in the game, so everything you see here is exactly what's in the box.

I should be getting this one to the table soon, so hopefully I'll also have a review up soon.
