I never thought I'd enjoy watching people play RPGs. I couldn't quite get into [Critical Role](http://geekandsundry.com/shows/critical-role/), though I love Matthew Mercer and crew. It's just too long. Too raw. Then came Wil Wheaton's [Titansgrave](http://geekandsundry.com/shows/titansgrave/). It was edited into one hour chunks, had some cool art to go with it, and was a joy to watch. I also really enjoyed the one-off [D&Diesel](http://geekandsundry.com/vin-diesel-nerdist-and-geek-and-sundrys-critical-roll-battle-in-ddiesel/) video that Geek & Sundry and The Nerdist put together with Vin Diesel.

Now I've discovered the Nerdist is putting out [Force Grey: Giant Hunters](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/force-grey-giant-hunters), an edited D&D show with Matthew Mercer as the DM and a bunch of geek celebrities as the players. Episodes are around 30 minutes long, and follow the adventures of Whil Wee-Tawn (Chris Hardwick), Dagny Halvor (Ashley Johnson), Brawlwin Chainminer (Shelby Fero), Joppa (Jonah Ray), Hitch (Utkarsh Ambudkar), and eventually Calliope (Brian Posehn). It's a bit more combat focused than Titansgrave was, but that's not a bad thing. It's also much shorter. 7 30-minute episodes as opposed to 10 1-hour episodes.

The show was put together with the help of Legendary Digital to promote the new Forgotten Realms Storm King’s Thunder adventure releasing in the fall.

I've been enjoying the hell out of this one, and am really hoping for more. Matt is a great DM, and the players are hilarious and a blast to watch as they stumble over each other and overcome the obstacles thrown at them.

Checkout Episode 1 below, then watch the rest on [The Nerdist's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl4T6p7km9daNfMrrEpm9mFzuP-TSmDMe).
