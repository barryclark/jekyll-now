Pokémon movie will be shown at over 200 Cinemark theaters on Saturday, October 29, and Tuesday, November 1. The movie will run with the “Pikachu's Vacation” short. You can [preorder tickets](https://www.cinemark.com/pokemon-the-first-movie) now for $5, which may be a good idea since I have a feeling shows will sell out.

For those unfamiliar with the movie, and it's tear jerker climax scene, it features Ash and Pikachu as they face off against the Legendary Pokémon Mewtwo. Mewtwo, furious at the humans who created him, clones Pokémon to create his own army for revenge.
