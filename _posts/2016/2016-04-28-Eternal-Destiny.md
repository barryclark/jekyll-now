Exploitive Anime: Animation Card Battle would have been a better name for this pile of rubbish. The original press release I got for this game promised "an epic card game inspired by myths, legends, and H.P. Lovecraft." I don't know what the hell they were talking about, because I'm not seeing much Lovecraft here.

Eternal Destiny was a free-to-play card game chock full of microtransactions originally launched on the PS Vita. The Steam version does away with the microtransactions in favor of a $9.99 price tag. Just because you take a shit game, remove the shitty fees from it, and put it up on Steam parading it as an actual, full-fledged game, doesn't make it any less of a shit game.

The card mechanics are pretty much the same we've seen in any tired, anime-inspired card battler. You can evolve cards to make more powerful cards that basically just smash against each other until enough damage makes its way through to the opponent and ends the match. All with a glossy coat of semi-NSFW anime art to keep the teens coming back for more. It's pretty damn disgraceful.

Keep your $9.99 and self respect and stay clear of this one. Better yet. Take that $9.99 and put it towards some [Spellweaver](http://store.steampowered.com/app/429680/), [HEX](http://store.steampowered.com/app/410380/), [Hearthstone](http://us.battle.net/en/int?r=hearthstone), [Magic Duels](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-duels), or [Pokemon](http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/play-online/) cards. You'll get a lot more play, and a lot more quality, with any of those titles.
