Some big news from The Pokémon Company today about the differences between Sun and Moon. Usually the different versions of a release have certain Pokémon that can only be caught in each one. Sun and Moon are also different in that the internal timer of the games are different. Sun's time will coincide with the system clock of the 3DS, while Moon's time will be shifted by 12 hours. Players will encounter different Pokémon on the same route depending on whether it is day or night, which means players will have different experiences according to their chosen version of the game.

Dexio and Sina from Pokémon X and Pokémon Y also return in Sun and Moon, giving the player the Zygarde Cube and ask you to collect Zygarde Cores and Zygarde Cells. These will create a path to catching the final form of the Legendary Pokémon. Another new item in the game will be the Poké Finder, which will allow you to snap pictures of Pokémon.

Pokémon Sun or Moon will also feature the Aether Foundation, an organization that works in the Alola region and conducts various research projects. Residing on Aether Paradise, the artificial island that they created, their goal is to care for and provide shelter to Pokémon that have been hurt. Members of the Aether Foundation include:

**Lusamine** The beautiful Lusamine is the president of the Aether Foundation.\\
**Faba** Faba can be identified by his signature accessory—green sunglasses. He is the Aether Foundation’s second-in-command.\\
**Wicke** As the assistant branch chief of Aether Paradise, Wicke has a very caring personality and supports Faba. She is loved by all of the Aether Foundation’s employees.

Aether Foundation are researching Ultra Beasts, creatures that possess mighty powers and pose a threat to humans and Pokémon. One such beast is known so far: UB-01 is an Ultra Beast that has a body composed of a glass-like substance. It constantly changes shape, and its movements resemble that of a young girl.

Here's a list of some of the new Pokémon announced:

![Null and Jangmo-o](/images/sunmoon/sonew.jpg)

**Type: Null**\\
**Type: Normal**

Type: Null is a Synthetic Pokémon which was constructed to synthesize the strengths of various Pokémon, making it adaptable enough to complete a mission that requires a Pokémon as strong as the Pokémon of mythology. The mask fitted to this Pokémon’s head is a piece of equipment designed to control its power. Type: Null is the partner Pokémon of a newly revealed character—Gladion, the taciturn enforcer of Team Skull, who places a high value on being strong in battle.


**Jangmo-o**\\
**Type: Dragon**

The Scaly Pokémon Jangmo-o has the pride of a warrior and never neglects its training in its pursuit of becoming stronger. This Pokémon uses the scales on its head as a weapon both offensively and defensively. It lives in harsh locales, like canyons, where it can train.

**Alolan Raticate**\\
**Type: Dark/Normal**

Raticate in Alola live in urban areas, leading to a higher-calorie diet than that of Raticate elsewhere. This means they have tough bodies but have gotten a lot fatter. They stockpile huge amounts of food in their nests and prefer fresh fruit and high-class ingredients. Alolan Raticate is the Totem Pokémon of the trial that takes place in Verdant Cavern on Melemele Island in Pokémon Moon.
