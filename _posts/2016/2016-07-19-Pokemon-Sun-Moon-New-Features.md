**Name: Wimpod**\\
Type: Bug/Water

Wimpod is the Turn Tail Pokémon. This Pokémon is a cowardly scavenger that eats or stores anything that’s been dropped in the sea meaning it is highly valued across the Alola region as a cleaner of the sea. Wimpod has the new Ability Wimp Out which causes this Pokémon to run away or swap out for another Pokémon when its HP drops below half in battle.
<br/>
<br/>

**Name: Bounsweet**\\
Type: Grass

Bounsweet is the Fruit Pokémon which gives off a delicious aroma. This aroma has a calming effect on humans, so many people across Alola let them live inside their homes as an air freshener.
<br/>
<br/>

**Name: Comfey**\\
Type: Fairy

The Posey Picker Pokémon Comfey picks flowers which it carries around with it. Comfey uses its soothing aroma to help treat people and Pokémon at Pokémon Centers and hospitals.
<br/>
<br/>

**Name: Mudsdale**\\
Type: Ground

Mudslade is the Draft Horse Pokémon with incredible power and stamina. Its legs are coated in a protective mud and its kick can destroy a car in a single blow. Mudslade has the Ability Stamina, a new Ability which raises a Pokémon’s Defense by one when hit by an attack.
<br/>
<br/>

**Name: Bewear**\\
Type: Normal/Fighting

Bewear is the Strong Arm Pokémon that must never be approached carelessly. With its strong and highly developed arms and legs, Bewear loves to give crushing bear hugs that will split anything in two.
<br/>
<br/>

**Name: Mimikyu**\\
Type: Ghost/Fairy

As the Disguised Pokémon, Mimikyu lives its life constantly covered by its cloth. Mimikyu’s Disguise Ability allows it to escape danger from an enemy’s attack once, then its appearance changes.

New features for the game include and updated Pokémon Global Link to include Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon, as well as Online Competitions and Live Competitions that players can host. Online Competitions are played over the internet, while Live Competitions are setup for players who are all in the same location.

Also, for the first time ever, players will be able to increase attributes of Pokémon that have reached level 100. The new feature, Hyper Training, will be accessed by visiting Mr. Hyper and paying him in Bottle Caps, a new item that can be collected in the Alola region.

Last, but not least, is the announcement that the mythical Pokémon Magearna, which is planned for distribution in North America later this year, will be distributed with a Bottle Cap held item.
