One of my favorite fighting game series, Guilty Gear, has its latest installment coming to Steam on December 17th. Titled Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator-, it will be available for $49.99, but will feature a launch-discount of 10%. Also, available at launch will be the One Dawn Bundle, which includes all of the DLC, for $64.99 USD. As a special bonus the game will include the GUILTY GEAR Sound Live 2014 Archives + which consists of 11 tracks plus 3 vocal tracks new in Revelator as well as Dizzy's Maine Theme song "One Dawn".

I've requested a review code, so hopefully I'll be able to get a review written and some streaming done soon.
