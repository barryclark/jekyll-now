The folks at [Coinworld.io](http://www.coinworld.io) (Scandinavia&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency news site) recently reached out about having me as a guest author. All it took was a quick [Messenger](http://m.me/scott.shapiro) conversation and we had a plan. I started this whole effort only a month ago, so I was happy to let them republish my most recent post about the [issues with Initial Coin Offerings](https://goo.gl/REAePr).&nbsp;
