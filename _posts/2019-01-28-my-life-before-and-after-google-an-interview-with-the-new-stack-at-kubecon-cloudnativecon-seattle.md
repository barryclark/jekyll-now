I'm always a fan of the wonderful Alex and Judy at The New Stack! In this interview, recorded at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2018 in Seattle, we chat about my aspirations as a teenager to work for Google, and how it's led to my current role at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation spreading the word about Kubernetes and cloud native.
