Ever being the entrepreneur, I've been playing around with Amazon's Print-On-Demand service [Merch by Amazon](https://merch.amazon.com/landing). I've been doing this since March - although I believe I requested an account sometime late last year - and in my first four months, I had lackluster sales. Hell, I had no sales at all in the month of April!

However, my sales since July have really taken off. In September alone I made around $270. In this blog post, I'm just going to display a few charts reporting my sales and revenue - one by gender, one by size, and one by color. Then I'll show you a weekly and monthly chart.

I don't intend to go into any analysis of these charts - I just had fun making them in [Microsoft Excel](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=microsoft+excel&linkCode=ll2&tag=hendrixjoseph-20&linkId=9adccab45a38f91338f29a22ca313f5b).
