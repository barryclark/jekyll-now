It's been nearly two weeks since I've posted anything. In fact, tomoroow marks two weeks since [my last post](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/november-2018-blog-statistics/). This is mostly because I'v been under the weather (idiom for being sick for my non-native English readers).

Thanksgiving festivities also took a bit of the first week of my hiatus. I've also been working hard on the bathroom remodel. This is [the bathroom remodel I've been working on since February](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/master-bath-remodel-demolition/) - before [my son was born](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/life-update/). 

I've also been a little bit busier at work than usual. That's a good thing, though.

I do plan on starting this month with my the next in my [Robinhood stock pick post series](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/tags/#stock-picks) and [Book Reading List post series](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/tags/#books). I should have these out by the end of the week.

It's also the last month of the year, which means I will publish my third-annual [End of Year Side Income Report](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/tags/#income-report). I'll also have a full year's worth of data for my monthly [Blog Statistics Reports](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/tags/#blog-statistics), and I fully intend on having some interesting analysis.

I've got a few other posts that are in the works. These are mostly DIY posts with video (sweating copper pipes and fixing a watch are two of them). I just need to get my stuff together and post them.
