This is a simple JavaScript game I made a while ago using HTML5's canvas element. The rules are simple: Click on a box when it appears to make it disappear. Every time you click a box, you get points. However, every time you click a box, the next one appears faster. If a box appears on top of another box, you lose points. "Peak" is the highest score you achieved before you started losing points.

<canvas id="boxGame" width="500" height="500">Sorry, your browser does not support the canvas!</canvas>
<p class="score">Score: <span id="score">0</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peak: <span id="peak">0</span></p>
<p class="score"><button id="clearButton">Start Over</button></p>
