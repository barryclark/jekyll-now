title: Manjaro Update 2015-07-20 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **fifth update** for Manjaro 0.8.13.

With this we updated to **Lumina Desktop 0.8.5**, **Mate 1.10.1**, **Cinnamon 2.6.13**, **Calamares 1.1.2**, **QT 5.5** incl. fixes for Plasma5, **kernel 3.13.11.23**, **systemd v222**, **clang 3.6.2** and bugfixed **xorg-server 1.17.2**. Budige desktop got updated, **flashplugin fixed**, lots of consolekit package updates and other small fixes.

To track the development even better we added 'calamares-dev', which is using 'kpmcore' for partitioning. Remember that this libriary is still at the beginning and might create data lost. So we still recommend to use 'calamares' as an alternative graphical installer.

As regular, this update includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (Mon Jul 20 08:11:52 CEST 2015).

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).


Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip Müller and the Manjaro Development Team
