title: Introducing the Holochain Open-Dev Blog
---

Hi everyone! We are **members of the holochain development community**, with a clear mission of creating a vibrant and open-source community of contributors around holochain development.

To achieve this, we think there is a **need for sharing guides and articles with content like best-practices, developer resources and patterns or "how-to"s** around diverse topics. 

This is meant to be a **collaborative effort**, in which we share and converge around practices each one of us is implementing. **We are not experts** in hApp development (we think holochain is so new that noone is!), rather we want to **start a conversation around similar issues we are all having**, and share what has worked for us. 

This is why this blog is **stored in a github repository**, ready to be forked and improved. Please **feel free to contribute to this blog** in the form of new articles or changes to existing ones in the [github repository](https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-open-dev.github.io). If you have an idea please reach out to us: we can support in stitching things together and connect the dots to help bring your idea to an article.

Because all of this, the **articles in this blog will always be in draft/beta** like state: we will iterate them to improve and aggregate the most knowledge we can from around the community. 

Our main **communication channel is the [Holochain Forum](https://forum.holochain.org)**. There, conversations are already starting around these issues. When the conversations settle around best-practices or solid conclusions, that knowledge can be crystalized in a post in this blog.

See you around, and happy coding!
