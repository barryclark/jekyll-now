## R packages

The gsubfn function is like gsub but can take a replacement function or certain other objects instead of the replacement string.

The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, 
grammar, and data structures.

## Write critique on a chart in published work (book/article/news website)
I pick a figure from a published piece called *Studying the impact of isis propaganda campaigns (2021)* written by Mitts, T., Phillips, G., 
and Walter, B. I would like to critique Figure 1 which presents the result of the difference-in-difference model, which is built to explore the 
research question that how the usage of social media platform by ISIS affect its audience. The authors' assumption is that in the absence of a 
propaganda dissemination, exposed and non-exposed users would follow parallel trends in their online support for the Islamic State.

As shown in the Figure, overtime trends in pro-ISIS rhetoric by the two groups were parallel in the pre- treatment period. Panel (A) shows 
the hourly average of pro-ISIS content by group in the seven days before propaganda disseminations, and Panel (B) zooms in to show the trends 
in the 24 hours before and after the disseminations.

In Panel (A), the x axis represents hours difference from the propaganda dissemination time, ranging from -175 hours to 0 hour. The y axis 
represents the average group pro-ISIS content, ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 tweets per hour. Since the black spots (exposed) and gray spots 
(not exposed) are randomly distributed and follow similar tendeny, we could say there is no difference between the exposed and not exposed groups.

In Panel (B), the x axis also represents hours difference from the propaganda dissemination time, but ranging from -25 hours to 25 hour. The y axis 
also represents the average group pro-ISIS content, with range from 0.08 to 0.24 tweets per hour. From the lines of black spots in pre and after-
treatment groups, we could see there is a big gap showing an obvious increase of pro-ISIS content among the exposed audiences after ISIS produces 
propaganda dissemination (as shown in the organe circle). In contrast, the pro-ISIS content among non-exposed twitter users does not change a lot
(as shown in the green circle). The different response between posted and not posted Twitter users after the propaganda dissemination time testifies 
the authors' assumption.
