title: Stochastic processes and distributions
---
We can derive probability distributions from a single random process: Binomial, Poisson, exponential, Gaussian.

Tossing a coinis the basic step. And see the behaviour 
for different limits: small probability and large number of tosses.

We can also use it as a more general explanation for rate equations or chemical reactions dynamics. Where
the event of getting a head y equivalent to the creation of a protein.

If $\gamma$ is the rate, that is defined as the average events per unit of time, like getting heads or protein creation.
For a coin with probability $p$ of heads, we know that the average number of heads after $N$ tosses is $Np$.
The time between tosses is $\Delta\tau$, and the total time $t$ after a large number of tosses is $t=N\Delta\tau$

$$\left\langle n \right\rangle = Np = \frac{t}{\Delta\tau}p = t\gamma$$
