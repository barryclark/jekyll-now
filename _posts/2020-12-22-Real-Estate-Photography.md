> I am a comercially licensed UAV Pilot with a registered drone for hire. My camera-in-the-sky can capture incredible images. This page contains a photo album from a ten-minute flight session. Photos have been reduced in quality by a factor of 10 so that they load faster here. At full quality my photos are anywhere from 10-40 MB, for this website they have been reduced to about 1MB.

If you need aerial photos, I can produce images like these images below. I can review the photos as I take them, and make sure I have exactly what I need by the end of the shoot. I have 3 batteries which last 30 minutes each, and I would review footage between each battery. To shoot photos on your location requires an hour and a half to two hours on site.

I can get a clear shot of your property from any height, up to **400 feet** above ground level. I can get a clear shot of your property from all angles.

I can capture both your property, and the view from your property in a single photo by using the Panoramic Mode on my drone. This holds the position of the drone while the drone takes a series of photos from different angles and then stiches them together. I can also take 360-degree VR Photos.

> I am a carpenter, and the photos on this page are from a ten minute flight session while I was on my lunch break. Let me use all 3 batteries (90 minutes) on my drone at your location, and I can get the perfect photos that you need for your listing!
