### So what is going on here?

Technology has changed the way we live our lives, one major component of this is the creation of a new language, a texting language that has developed to keep up with our ever speeding up society. Through research, we plan to show what the language has become and how it ever got there in the first place. We must embrace this new language trend but never loose touch with the formal language that texting is derived from.

By using credible sources backing up our theory that a new language has been evolving and a little fun to actually present our research findings, we believe that our society is only doing what it must do, move forward.  Texting is not the end of our language, just simply the beginning of a new one.  

###Something cool we have found

There are so many different ways to say a lot of common phrases.  With proper researching, you can find literally pages upon pages of texting lingo.  

See you for our update in a few weeks!
