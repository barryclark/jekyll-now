# Code
I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.

If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,
you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:

     <blockquote>
         <p>For example.</p>
     </blockquote>
