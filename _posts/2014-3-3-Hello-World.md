**OOP** has become a standard way of programming.OOP makes your programs more flexible and understandable.OOP code is a lot neater and organized because if your want to add on a new capability you just create a new function without touching any of the old code.<br />
OOP requires less code to get things done because of a concept called inheritance.For example if we created a basic car object.The car object is what we would refer to as the superclass.A class is a blueprint that describes how to build many objects.<br />
So how does a class create an object? Each object will have variables called instance variables in OOP.Each object will recieve functions called methods in OOP.Each object has the ability to easily overide those functions it can't use.
If we create a subclass of the superclass,in OOP this is known as extending the superclass.
Inheritance is good:decreases duplicate code,eliminates looking for what code needs to be changed,avoids breaking previously working code and simplifies your code  overall.
Overloadind methods-This is to create multiple methods with the same name but either a different return type,number of arguments or type of arguments.<br />
**Objects and classes**[edit]<br />
Languages that support object-oriented programming typically use inheritance for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either classes or prototypes. Those that use classes support two main concepts:

**class** - the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves. i.e. Classes contains the data members and member functions.<br />
**Objects** - instances of classes<br />
Objects sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. For example, a graphics program may have objects such as "circle", "square", "menu". An online shopping system might have objects such as "shopping cart", "customer", and "product". Sometimes objects represent more abstract entities, like an object that represents an open file, or an object which provides the service of translating measurements from U.S. customary to metric<br />.

Each object is said to be an instance of a particular class (for example, an object with its name field set to "Mary" might be an instance of class Employee). Procedures in object-oriented programming are known as methods; variables are also known as fields, members, attributes, or properties. This leads to the following terms:

**class variables** - belong to the class as a whole; there is only one copy of each one
Instance variables or attributes - data that belongs to individual objects; every object has its own copy of each one
Member variables - refers to both the class and instance variables that are defined by a particular class
**Class methods** - belong to the class as a whole and have access only to class variables and inputs from the procedure call
**Instance methods** - belong to individual objects, and have access to instance variables for the specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variables<br />
Objects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structure, and in many languages are effectively pointers, serving as actual references to a single instance of said object in memory within a heap or stack. They provide a layer of abstraction which can be used to separate internal from external code. External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable. Objects are created by calling a special type of method in the class known as a constructor. A program may create many instances of the same class as it runs, which operate independently. This is an easy way for the same procedures to be used on different sets of data.<br />

**Object-oriented programming** that uses classes is sometimes called class-based programming, while prototype-based programming does not typically use classes. As a result, a significantly different yet analogous terminology is used to define the concepts of object and instance.
