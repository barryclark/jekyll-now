February is a short month (and the only truly four-week month) but I still managed to finish two books. And, of course, I've read plenty of children's books to my son.

## Books I Read for Me

* [A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes by Adam Rutherford](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781615194049/30241883415)
* [CyberStorm by Matthew Mather](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780991677191/30239924995)

If you've been following these book reading lists since at least [last December](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/december-2018-book-reading-list/), you'll know that I've discovered [Prime Reading](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/bookshelf/prime/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) - a benefit of [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) where Prime members can borrow up to ten ebooks at a time.

Both the books above I read via the Prime Reading program.

I also bought a Kindle at a thrift store for around eight bucks. It's an older Kindle, but well worth the eight bucks. It's much better than reading ebooks on my phone - way fewer distractions.

The thing with reading to my son is that I have to find ways to ensure he's a captive audience. As I've said many times in previous posts, he'd much rather be on the floor exploring and playing than being read to.

So far I've found two ways to make him a captive audience. The first is to read to him while I'm holding him when he's eating his bottle. Bottle time might be over soon since he's approaching his first birthday. So the other way I've found to read to him - and I've only done this once - is to read to him while he's strapped into his high chair.

Have you read any good books lately?
