Ok, it's been a while since I posted, so I thought I'd just throw this up:

I found this game because somehow this game linked to my site. It's cute and fun: basically, you have to keep these anti-monkey “bloons” (actually balloons) from getting through. So you put up various monkey defenses. I didn't do really good in the youtube above. You should try it out though. Here's the link: http://www.monkeytowerdefense.com/monkey-tower-defence-4.htm

This game belongs to the subgenre known as "[Tower Defense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense)," part of the overall strategy genre. The company [Com2uS](http://www.com2us.com/ENGGlobal/Corporate/About.asp) actually holds the US trademark for the term Tower Defense, which is curious, since the genre is older than that company. Does anyone know what the first "Tower Defense" game was?

Until next time

Joe
