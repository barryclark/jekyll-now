title: Career Documentation

The longer your career goes on, the more difficult it can be to remember the things you've accomplished. Sometimes it can be a challenge to remember what you've done in the last week.

Like software, you should document your career. When it comes to performance evaluations, the problems are:

* You don't remember what you've done
* Your manager doesn't remember what you've done

Your first piece of documentation should be what Julia Evans calls a [Brag Document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/). It's a document where you outline the things you've done, both technical and non-technical. Scheduling a half hour every two weeks to update your brag document should be frequent enough that you don't forget your accomplishments. Julie states this document can be 5 to ten pages long over the course of the year.

Based on this document, you should create a Career Management Document. This is like a resume on steroids, but is intended only for your own use. In it, you should document your jobs, supervisors, and dates of employment. You could document your salary here as well (remember, this document is for you only). Finally, every quarter or so, you should filter the contents of your brag document and copy the highlights here.

(You can learn more about the Career Management Document in the Manager Tools podcast episode on [Systematic Career Documentation](https://www.manager-tools.com/2010/06/systematic-career-documentation-part-1-hall-fame-guidance#).)

The Career Management Document is used to assemble resumes that are tailored to your individual applications.

Finally, the last document to create is a FAB. These are Facts, Accomplishments, and Benefits. Some consulting companies use this format to better connect their consultants with clients because resumes often don't quite hit the mark for consultancies. 

Facts lay out what experience you have. (e.g., 8 years of experience as a software developer)

Accomplishments cover the specific results that resulted from the Facts. (e.g., Rolled out a new system that generated 10% annual cost savings)

Benefits turn the Facts into examples of what you can do for your new company. (e.g., I discover places where costs can be reduced through software automation).

This document would be particularly useful for your career in preparation for interviews. Not only does it allow you to remember what you've done in your career, but also how that would benefit a potential new employer.
