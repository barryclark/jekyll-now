This month marks the 18th monthly blog statistic report I've made in a row. I feel as if my numbers tend to be going in a general upward trend. Unsure if that's because I've been paying attention to those numbers or not.

Anyway, here's June's numbers:

I was able to publish five posts this month:

* [Eight Common Debts That You Don't Normally Think of As Debt ](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/eight-common-debts-that-you-dont-normally-think-of-as-debt/)
* [Turn a Stream of Arrays to Single Stream in Java](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/turn-a-stream-of-arrays-to-single-stream-in-java/)
* [May 2019 Book Reading List](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/may-2019-book-reading-list/)
