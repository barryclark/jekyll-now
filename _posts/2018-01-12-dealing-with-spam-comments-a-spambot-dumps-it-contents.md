It's been a couple of months since I implemented [a more traditional-looking comment system](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/new-commenting-system-staticman/) on my blogs, and, coupled with provided meaningful comments on other people's blogs, I've had a moderate amount of success. One issue I've had to deal with, and I'm sure other bloggers deal with this as well, is the number of spam comments from bots. I do look at and approve / deny every comment, so thankfully none of these have actually appeared in any comment sections.

I did get one spam comment that seemed odd. The comment itself was spammy, especially with the poor spelling and bad grammar often associated with spam. But what was unusual about this comment was the *length*.

A typical spambot will only comment a sentence or two out of a list of several sentences. It turns out that the spambot for this particular spam comment dumped its entire contents. That is, instead of just choosing a couple random pre-written comments, it wrote *every* sentence.

I don't know why it did this - perhaps it's because my blog isn't a Wordpress or Blogger blog, so the comment form is just different enough that it caused the spambot to break. My comment system served as a type of [honeypot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing))

*Winnie-the-Pooh style honeypot*

In case you're wondering what the dump looked like, and perhaps you're wanting to see if any spam comments made into either your blog or someone else's, here's what the comment was (feel free to scroll past it):

Note the flowery language that talks about how great the post is, but it never really mentions what the post is. I also like the casual mention of [MySpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace) as if it's still a thing.

Maybe I should do something about preventing spam comments to begin with. What do you do about spam?
