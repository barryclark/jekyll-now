title: Manjaro Update 2015-08-03 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **seventh update** for Manjaro 0.8.13.

With this we updated **nvidia** to **352.30**, **linux312** to **3.12.45**, **linux313** to **3.13.11.24**, **mesa** to **10.6.3**, **wine** to **1.7.48**, **systemd** to **v223**, **os-prober** to **v1.66**, **LibreOffice** to **4.4.5**, some Gnome packages and libraries for python.

Additionally we fixed some issues within manjaro-tools and refreshed our mirrorlist. As regular, this update includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (Sun Aug 2 08:47:15 CEST 2015).

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).


Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip Müller and the Manjaro Development Team
