[Last October I posted about my electric bill over the year](http://hendrixjoseph.github.io/my_electric_bill_over_the_past_year/). In order to save money, I switched my supplier from DP&L to AEP via [Ohio's Apples-to-Apples website](http://www.energychoice.ohio.gov/ApplesToApplesComparision.aspx?Category=Electric&TerritoryId=9&RateCode=1), lowering my costs from 7.3&cent; to 4.59&cent; per kilowatt.

So far, I've been happy with the results. Before the switch, my average bill was around $28, and now it's averaged $20:

Of course, part of the reason the bill is lower is that my average usage has gone down - from around 200 units to 180 units (probably in kilowatt hours, but the bill just has a number for the usage with no unit):

My rate was guaranteed for six months, so I have one more bill at this rate. Afterward, I plan on going back to the Apples-to-Apples site and signing up for another low rate from another company. When I signed up in October, AEP had the lowest rate - there's now some that have rates between 3&cent; and 4&cent; with contracts ranging from one month to three. I'll probably do a three month one, as I plan on [selling my house](http://hendrixjoseph.github.io/four-things-i'm-excited-for-in-2017/#selling-my-house) soon.

Keep in mind my heat is done with gas, but thanks to the mild winter it hasn't exceeded $90.
