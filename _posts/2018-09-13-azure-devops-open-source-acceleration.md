There was awesome new few days ago on [Azure blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-devops/) about changing Vsts to Azure DevOps, on fist look it look to be not important.

But after look is seams to be a very important step by giving all unlimited CI/CD minutes for open source [Announcing Azure Pipelines with unlimited CI/CD minutes for open source](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-azure-pipelines-with-unlimited-ci-cd-minutes-for-open-source/).

I assume there will be more very good staff coming and this is just start.
