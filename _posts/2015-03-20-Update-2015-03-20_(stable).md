We are happy to announce our **fifth update** for Manjaro 0.8.12.

This time we are shipping the latest **mesa 10.5.1** and lot of XFCE fixes. With **KDE Frameworks 5.8.0** all issues with **Plasma5 5.2.1** should now been fixed. We will recreate some new KDE5 install medias soon.

We updated linux310, linux314 and linux319 and added needed security fixes like openssh 6.8p1 and openssl 1.0.2.a.

Some work went into our graphical package managers. Pamac got needed fixes and Octopi a face-lift. Tell us what you think about those changes ... Other than that we have a new point-release for Calligra and Virtualbox.

Some updates to mention: clang 3.6.0, virtualbox 4.3.26, mesa 10.5.1, calligra 2.9.1, KDE Frameworks 5.8.0, manjaro-tools 0.9.7.2, openssh 6.8p1, openssl 1.0.2.a

This includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (Mar 20 18:29:46 CET 2015)
