A travel blogging platform for hotels, helping them deliver savvy local recommendations and suggest experience to their guests. 

Developed with Swift for iOS 9 and later iPad devices.

# Curated content for the traveling user

Right from the start, we knew the project had some special constraints:

- Minimal footprint, for downloading on overcrowded Wifi connections (like on airports and hotels)
- Reliable offline mode, for users without constant connection while traveling

This context guided all of our decisions, including technical ones. We chose taking further advantage of Firebase (already used on the iPad app) for having always cached content available to read. And we also ended up switching from Google Maps to Mapbox for granular control over offline vector maps.


# Features

- Local recommendations by hotel's front desk
- Offline maps and articles
- Driving and walking directions
