Jekyll uses Markdown for formating, so all the Markdown commands work in Jekyll.

# Headers

The largest header is a single `#`. For subsequently smaller headers, add another `#`

```
# Main header
## Secondary header
### Tertiary header...
```

# Main header
## Secondary header
### Tertiary header...

# Emphasis

```
*Single asterisk for italics*

**Double asterisk for bold**

***Triple asterisk for bold and italics***
```

*Single asterisk for italics*

**Double asterisk for bold**

***Triple asterisk for bold and italics***

# Code

Use a grave accent " \` " for `code` (it's to the left of 1 on your keyboard)

```

```

# HTML tags

You can also use HTML tags. `<b>Bold with HTML</b>` gives you:

<b>Bold with HTML</b>

# Lists

- Dash with a space for an unordered list

The way ordered lists are down in Markdown is a bit quirky in my opinion. They are created as follows:
```
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three
```
However, it doesn't actually matter what the numbers are, so I just use `1.` for each item that that I can easily add something to the list 
later and the raw code won't look out of order

```
1. Do this
1. Then do this
1. And finally this
```
