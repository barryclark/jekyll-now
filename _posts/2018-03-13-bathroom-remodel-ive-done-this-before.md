A couple of posts ago I talked about how I am [remodeling my master bathroom](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/master-bath-remodel-demolition/). I'm still working on that - still in the demolition phase despite working on it for two weeks - so I wanted to show some previous work I've done. In the house I lived in before, I remodeled the bathroom, and have been told I did a good job.

This post is going to be mostly pictures, culminating in a photo of that completed bathroom.

So, there you have it. I can do this!
