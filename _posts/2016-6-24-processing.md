 Last 2 days we did processing. I have already written a post about my first animations. After the lunch we tried something new - working with images.

 I expected being bored but when I saw how pretty it can be I was shocked, pleasently shocked. I took a picture of the love of my life - Jesse Eisenberg :D

 Firstly I did just normally then changed my code by combinig code of my previous scetch (animation) with a new one. You MUST see it! I really fell in love with that.
