* Uninstall Applications using CleanMyMac
* Some Applications/Softwares might not be detected completely using CleanMyMac. Example: [R](https://osxuninstaller.com/uninstall-guides/uninstall-r/)
* Homebrew
    * [Clean Up Brew](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27508590/homebrew-size-of-cellar). Check size of cleanup using `brew cleanup -n` and `brew cleanup` to perform it.
    * Check the size of Cellar (where homebrew installs) by using `du -sh /usr/local/Cellar`
* Check iMovies files in `~/Movies/iMovie Library`. I happened to find 7 GBs just lying there from old resources which I no longer needed :)
