Doesn't that intro make you feel nostalgic?! It was my honour to present Zalando with the CNCF Top End User Award, in recognition of its notable contributions to the cloud native ecosystem.

> Zalando SE started its cloud native journey in 2015 in its transition from on-premise data centers to the public cloud. Zalando leveraged numerous CNCF projects, including Kubernetes, Prometheus, CNI, and etcd to deliver a superior experience for over 1,300 Zalando developers and serves over 34 million active customers across 17 countries.

>“Since joining CNCF in early 2017, Zalando has been an active member of the Foundation’s End User community, in particular chairing the Developer Experience SIG,” said Cheryl Hung, Director of Ecosystem at Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “Active across the community, Zalando has provided upstream contributions to Kubernetes, created and maintained a number of open source projects to expand the Kubernetes ecosystem and provided significant insights into the company’s successes and failures. We are pleased to present them with this award and excited to watch the company’s continued contributions to the community.”
