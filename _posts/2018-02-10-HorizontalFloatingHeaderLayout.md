A custom UICollectionViewLayout inspired by iOS' own Emoji keyboard layout. Scroll horizontally while keeping your headers at the top.

Currently updated with Swift 4.0 for iOS 9 and later projects.

# Lag-free scrolling and friendly delegate methods

For a complete control over the scrolling performance, I decided to make it a UICollectionViewLayout's subclass instead of inheriting from UICollectionViewFlowLayout. The result is a scalable and performant layout you can easily use on your projects.

# Features

- Importable with CocoaPods
- Easy delegate implementation
