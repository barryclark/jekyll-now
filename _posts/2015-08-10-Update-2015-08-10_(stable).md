title: Manjaro Update 2015-08-10 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **eighth update** for Manjaro 0.8.13.

With this we updated once again **Octopi**, **systemd** to **v224**, **menulibre** to **2.0.7**, **LibreOffice** to **5.0**, our keyring, some of our kernels to the latest point-releases, added **linux42** to our kernel family, pushed out some python updates and released **mhwd 0.5.6** with some changes to the Intel driver configs. 

Now we will default back to '**UXA**'. Users may need to edit their acceleration settings within the '**/etc/X11/mhwd.d/intel.conf**' file.

As regular, this update includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (Sun Aug 9 19:56:44 CEST 2015).

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).


Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip Müller and the Manjaro Development Team
