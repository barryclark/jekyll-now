title: Embarking on Euler

Excited to finally, systematically start on the [Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives)! I have fiddled around with the algorithms that would give correct solutions to some of these problems. Since being immersed in Python day in day out, it's a good opportunity to explore these challenges. I will be posting solutions I come up with and see what better/more efficient solutions look like.
