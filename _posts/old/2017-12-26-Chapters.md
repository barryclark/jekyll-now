Concept book reader tailored for book lovers. Intended for fixing shortcoming of the digital book experience.

# Getting back what we lost when going digital

There's no denying in the obvious advantages of digital books. But they're still far from replacing the experience of reading their physical counterparts.

This concept app aimed for demostrating there's still room to grow for our favorite ebook readers.

Its main feature is something called *The Bookmark*, which brings back the spatial and progress awereness we always had with physical books.

# Features

- Gently on the eyes UI
- Vertical scrolling
- *The Bookmark*, acting as both a progress indicator and a chapter skimming control
