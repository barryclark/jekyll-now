Our first reading group met on Week 2 of Winter Quarter 2018, and we wanted to go over some of the key papers regading recent advancements in Convolutional Neural Networks. To this end, we read the AlexNet paper, GoogLeNet (Incepetion modules) paper, and the ResNet paper. During our discussion, we dove deep into a discussion on the AlexNet paper and the ConvNet architecture in general. These are some notes regarding the important points of the paper, and you can find the corresponding slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e9A6mn-tB-LhCfRKsJBUoDU-ePmQjpSfGFL9HINuJgM/edit?usp=sharing). 


## AlexNet Paper (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)



#### Introduction

- Until recently (i.e. in 2012) computer vision datasets were quite small, compared to ImageNet, which contains 15 million labeled images in 22k categories
- Object recognition is a hard problem, so we can't rely on data alone to solve it
- Need a specialized model different from traditional DNNs that incorporate some assumptions/prior knowledge, which is what CNNs do
- CNNs are highly configurable, meaning that the number of convolutional and fully connected layers, and number of hidden units in each layer can be controlled
  - Due to the assumptions it makes about images (hierarchical structure, spatial invariance), CNNs typically have fewer parameters than DNNs of the same size, so they are easier to train
- Need a fast implementation of 2d convolution and a lot of GPUs



#### The Dataset

- ImageNet dataset: 15 million images belonging to one of 22k categories
- Preprocessing applied:
  - downsampled to fixed resolution (256 x 256)
  - pixel values were centered



#### The Architecture

- Used the ReLu nonlinearity instead of sigmoid/tanh

  - Simply can't do deep learning with sigmoid, the problem of vanishing gradients is just too big. 
  - ReLu gradients are 0 or 1, which means that they don't dramatically scale down the incoming gradient, solving the vanishing gradient problem
  - Easier/faster implementation: max(0, x)
  - Encourage sparsity in the model
  - Issues: "dead" ReLu's -> ReLus that never pass any activations through

- Network trainign was split across 2 GPUs

  - neurons were split across GPUs, only communicate at certain layers
  - chose this pattern with cross validation

- Local Response Normalization

  - Goal is to improve generalization
  - A type of "lateral inhibition" -> ability for an excited neuron to subdue/normalize its neighbors
  - Basically when a neuron has a very large activation, we want it to become even more sensitive/activate more when we use that input
    - so subdue the other neurons so that this one is relatively more excited
  - dampen responses of surrounding neurons
  - basically enhance the "peaks" and dampen the "flats" to model biological neurons and make neurons more sensitive to certain inputs

- Used overlapping pooling

- Overall architecutre

  - 8 layers: 5 conv and 3 fully connected, and then a 1000 way softmax
  - cross-entropy loss function, basically maximum likelihood approach

- Reducing overfitting:

  - One way: data augmentation/label preserving transformations: flip/rotate the image, extract random patches
  - Dropout: randomly set some proportion of the activations to 0
    - Means that the network cannot rely on specific presence of features/activations -> less overfitting
    - neurons learn more reduntant, robust representations
    - Each time a different architecture (that shares weights) is sampled, so it's like training an ensemble of correlated networks

  #### Details of Learning

  - network was trained with stochastic gradient descent using momentum
    - weight decay was also used (at each step $w_i$ was decayed by $w_i -= 0.0005*w_i$)
    - important to note that this was not just a regularizer, it actually decreased model training error
  - random initialization from a 0 mean Gaussian



## GoogLeNet Paper

- Note: The L is capitalized to pay homage to Yann LeCun (Facebook) who is the father of CNNs

  #### Motivation & High-Level Considerations

  - Easiest way to increase perf of DNNs is to make them longer and wider

    - more hidden layers, more hidden neurons

  - Comes at the expense of overfitting and vastly increased computational needs though

  - There's actually a quadratic increase in computation if the number of filters in 2 conv layers increases

  - Sparsely connected architectures is a good solutions

    - mimicks bio systems
    - Arora et al established theoretical work on modelling probability distributions of a dataset with a deep neural network

  - Conflict in use of sparsity that is supported by theoretical results, but our current hardware is optimized for operations on dense collections:

    - very fast 2d convolutions and dense matmults

      ​

    #### Architecture Details

    - Overarching theme of Inception: create a network architecture that approximates a sparse structure, by only using dense components so we can take advantage of current hardware
    - Theoretical goal: build a network layer by layer
      - look at the correlation statistics of the last layer, and combine the highly correlated units (neurons)
      - These groups become the units in the next layer 
    - Sparsely connected neurons in a deep network will represent the probability distribution of a dataset, observe correlations in activations to construct network layer by layer
    - Main idea of inception: at each conv layer, do a bunch of different ops:
      - 1x1 conv, 3x3 conv, 5x5 conv, max pool and then concatenate the output of all of them
    - Naive approach of doing straight 3x3 convs and 5x5 cones results in parameter blowups and computational inefficienty
    - Want to keep representations from blowing up, so 1 x 1 convolutions were used

    #### GoogLe Net

    - Use of 1x1 convolutions was really important for dimensionality reduction
    - Network was 22 layers deep, which introduced the concern that backpropagation may lead to vanishing gradients/slower learning
      - Used auxiliary classifiers in the beginning/middle/end of the network to improve the gradient signal
      - The gradients from these classifiers were added to the true gradient, but discounted by a weight

## ResNet Paper

- 152 layers deep (wow!)
- In traditional learning, we have an input x and then we do some series of operations (typically conv->relu->pooling) to get the output F(x).
- With residual learning, we basically want to remember the input into the previous layer and use that
- So we create a new $H(x)$ and let it equal $F(x)$ (the output from our layer) $+ x$ (the input into the previous layer)
- The authors hypothesized that it is easier to optimize residual mappings than the original mappings

#### Deep Residual Learning

- Degradation problem in traditional networks: 
  - If we keep stacking layers that must do identity mappings (i.e. the layer just outputs the input) then intuitively we wouldn't expect the error to get any worse
  - But according to a few experiments, it did, indicating that optimizers have trouble approximating identity mappings more than a few layers deep
  - Building block is y = F(x, W) + x
  - F(x, W) is the residual mapping to be learned, and it is equal to H(x) - x, and H(x) is what we want to output
- Implementation:
  - Repeated conv layers followed by occasional residual blocks, where previous input is added to that layer's output
  - Learning approach:
    - Used batch norm
    - SGD with batches of size 256, no dropout
    - Momentum & weight decay
    - Same 10-crop testing approach as AlexNet (extract 10 random 224 x 224 patches from the 256 x 256 image, and return the most likely label across those 10)
