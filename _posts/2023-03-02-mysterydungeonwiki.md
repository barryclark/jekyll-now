We are pleased to welcome the **Mystery Dungeon Franchise Wiki** as the newest member of the Gaming Wiki Network.

The Mystery Dungeon Franchise Wiki originated as the "Shiren the Wanderer Wiki" on Gamepedia.com, a fork of the original Shiren the Wanderer Wikifoundry Wiki (née Wetpaint Wiki), founded by karmarogue on Wetpaint.com on March 11, 2008. 

On September 11, 2019, Korra Baskerville upgraded it into the Gamepedia.com "Mystery Dungeon Wiki", an amalgamation of many previous Mystery Dungeon projects that focused on all the Mystery Dungeon games. 

On November 7, 2020, Adkuate, Blue, and Korra II took the wiki independent as the MDFW, and the focus shifted to covering all Mystery Dungeon content, no longer being hindered by Gamepedia's game-only limitations.

Please check out the Mystery Dungeon Franchise Wiki at [https://mysterydungeonwiki.com](https://mysterydungeonwiki.com/wiki/Mystery_Dungeon_Franchise_Wiki) and stay tuned for more updates in the future!
