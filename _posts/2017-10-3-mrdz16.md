#Mark's Blog Post
Howdy and welcome to my website! My name is Mark Rodriguez and I am a senior Technology management student at Texas A&M. This website was made as an assignment for my 476 DevOps class where we each added our own content into a repository. Now I added this little piece of text to tell you a little bit about myself. I have always been interested in technology and spend a lot of my free time just learning about new things I find interesting. I used to be an applied mathematics major for two years until I decided to switch into Technology Management after I reevaluated what I wanted to do for a living. On top of my interest in technology, I also enjoy playing soccer, camping, and Tailgating! Thanks and Gig em
