title: Inverse probability simulation
---
We usually think in the classical experiment of determining the number of heads given a bayased coin. But how can we think 
about to know the value of heads probability of the coin given the number of heads?

bayes or Lapace create se following experiment: at random you drop a ball in a teable, mark the horizontal position, and then drop at random another ball and see
if it falls at the right of the horizontal position. We can measure the distribution of position x given the number of drops to the right.
