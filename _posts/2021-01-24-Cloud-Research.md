> I really appreciate a good sunset, and want to be able to predict top-tier sunset opportunities based on aviation weather reports. I began a scientific study to determine exactly what factors create a jaw-dropping sunset.

# Cloud Research

As a drone pilot, I can get a unique perspective of the sky, because the camera is in the sky. I can rise above trees and get an unobstructed view of a sunset. However, an amazing sunset does not happen every night. Some sunsets are much more aesthetic than others. One such factor is your location, and for me in my area, the best place to take a sunset photo would be anywhere that there is a body of water beneath, which reflects the colors of the sky. The sun paints orange and red and magenta in the sky, and to me the more non-blue and non-grey colors the better the sunset.

I would rate sunsets on a scale of 1-10. A 10/10 sunset would be properly framed with an interesting foreground as well as a vibrant sunset. It would be taken at the correct time where the clouds are at their peak in terms of color. A 10/10 sunset would have the right amount of cloud coverage, not too much and not too litte. The clouds will be at certain altitudes, because clouds that are too low are never lit up by the sun. These are the variables I seek to understand.

I need to predict a good sunset because I do not want to drive to the "perfect" sunset spot only to have a lame non-sunset, not get a good photo, and essentially waste an hour. So in this effort I have begun to be able to identify the different types of clouds. I am studying the timing of when clouds at certain altitudes become lit up by the sun. There is always an "official" sunset time for any location, so when is the optimal time to take the photo - 10 minutes before sunset? 10 minutes after?

In just a week of studying, I have already reached some conclusions. I will take it day-by-day and show each discovery from that day.

Sunset time:
METAR @ sunset time: 

The weather report says that there is a ___ cloud cieling at ___ feet

Cloud ID: Altocumulus. Time of photo:

[]()

This is an altocumulus cloud, which means it is mid-altutide (alto-), and is a fluffy cloud (cumulus). The is a southern-facing photo and from this photo you can see that only the western side of the cloud is lit up by the sun. The sunlight can't penetrate the entire cloud, and so basically the cloud is too large to be fully illuminated. A better cloud formation would be smaller cumulus clouds spaced apart. _Altocumulus floccus_ would be one of the best cloud formations to occur during a sunset. The cotton-candy cloud colors contrasting with the blue sky are very aesthetically pleasing.

Cloud ID: Stratocumulus humilus. Time of photo:

[]()

The cloud above the lake here is a stratocumulus humilus. It is low altitude (strato-), fluffy-ish cloud (cumulus) which is wider than it is tall (humilus). If it formed more of a layer, it would be a simple stratus cloud, but it has a well-defined form and is therefore stratocumulus. You can see that the higher altitude clouds are lit up by the sun, while the lower altitude cloud does not catch the sun's rays.

This is an altocumulus cloud

This is the same altocumulus cloud, 3 minutes later. As you can see, timing was key. Clouds at this altitude peak at a very specific time.

There was a variety of clouds on this day. Low on the horizon are stratocumulus clouds. In the middle is a sheet of altostratus translucidus clouds. Through the hole in that cloud sheet you can see high altitude cirrocumulus clouds.

Based on the sky from this day, I thought the sunset might be pretty good. The high altitude clouds spaced apart seemed like they would be lit up all over the sky.

This was the only cloud in the sky to be lit up around sunset time. The little, low cloud. Why? Possibly because of the altostratus layer blocking the suns rays. It is possible that the tops of this cloud was well lit, but from below we could not see the sunset affecting the clouds.

The weather report says that there is a ___ cloud cieling at ___ feet

Cloud ID: Altostratus translucidus. Time of photo:

This is the eastern horizon which was the part of the sky which was most lit around sunset time. The cloud coverage on the western horizon was too dense for any clouds to be lit up. 

Cloud ID: Altostratus floccus. Time of photo: 

[]()

These clouds, all over the sky, would make for a fantastic sunset.

Cloud ID: Altostratus radiatus. Time of photo: 

[]()

These clouds were very interesting to me. Forming parrallel lines, this cloud formation is relatively rare. One of the more interesting clouds I have taken a picture of. I look forward to capturing more rare clouds in photos.

# In conclusion

Learning to identfy clouds is essential for predicting a great sunset, in addition to reading and understanding the most recent local weather report.. Knowing how each cloud behaves as the sun sets can help optimize your arrival time on location. If a certain type of cloud does not get lit until after sunset, it is not necessary to arrive early to get the picture you want. Dense clouds and extensive cloud coverage will not allow the light to illuminate the sky the way you want. My scientific research with my drone has confirmed what I have read online: you want mid-altitude clouds, with 30-70% cloud coverage. If it is completely overcast, you could comfortably skip an attempt at a sunset picture that day. I have found that sunsets are basically "over" about 15 minutes after official sunset time, and vibrant sunsets occur an hour before to 15 minutes after offical sunset time. One of the most important aspects of sunsets is a partially clear sky, where the sun's rays can travel and land on a cloud, illuminating it. Too many clouds will simply block the suns rays, and light up the top of the cloud, which we cannot see from below unless it is a small cloud that allows light to travel through. I think the best advice would be: be in the right place at the right time, and simply capture the photo when the opportunity presents itself. As clouds in the sky rapidly change over time, it can be very hard to predict if the clouds present 1 hour before sunset will still be around when those clouds are supposed to light up.

As of now I would say the top 3 clouds for a sunset would be

* Cirrus clouds
* Altocumulus floccus
* Altocumulus mamatus
