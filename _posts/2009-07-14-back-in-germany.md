So getting from Prague to Venice proved to be either way too time consuming or expensive. Or even both. Looks like I have to change my plans and head down to Italy via Bern (Switzerland) which will be cool, jusrt completely different to how I imagined I would tackle Europe.

Anyway I split from Drew and Ash this morning and I&#8217;m in Munich now which I&#8217;m actually really stoked about, I didn&#8217;t expect I would actually have the chance to make it here so one hinderance actually turned into something really positive. Don&#8217;t know yet whether I will leave tomorrow or stay another night, I might go for a walk this arvo and decide later tonight.

I was homeless when I arrived, and both being late afternoon and middle of summer meant getting a hostel wasn&#8217;t easy. In fact, not even possible so I&#8217;ve booked some hotel for the night, looks like there are a few hostels available for tomorrow night if I can decide early enough that I want to stay. Worry about that later anyway.

Right now it&#8217;s really hot and I&#8217;ve already wasted an hour or so of sightseeing by being here looking for accom so I&#8217;m off again.
