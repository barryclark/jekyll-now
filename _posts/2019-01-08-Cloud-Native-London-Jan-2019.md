The room was raring to go for the first Cloud Native London meetup of 2019, featuring three enthralling talks, and I was back hosting!

Thanks to our sponsors [StorageOS](https://storageos.com/), [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Contino](https://www.contino.io/), [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), and [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/).

First up is securing and integrating legacy applications, followed by a discussion about observable Kubernetes, and wrapping up with me giving an overview of the mission of Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

Nic Jackson from HashiCorp discussed ["Securing and integrating legacy applications with Kubernetes and Consul Connect"](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13339-securing-and-integrating-legacy-applications-with-kubernetes-and-consul-connect), focusing on the following topics:

* Introduction to modern networks security and service meshes
* Running Consul Connect and Envoy on Kubernetes
* Securely integrating external applications such as data stores and legacy applications with Kubernetes

Following that, Samir Bennacer from Elastic talked about ["Observable Kubernetes with the Elastic Stack"](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13338-observable-kubernetes-with-the-elastic-stack), discussing:

* An intro to Elastic Stack
* Kubernetes challenges 
* Logging and monitoring Kubernetes
* APM tracing

Ending up with a demo.

Finally I gave an overview about CNCF in ["Crossing the chasm with cloud native"](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13394-crossing-the-chasm-with-cloud-native). My takeaways were:

* The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (cncf.io) is a non-profit, founded in 2015, as part of the Linux Foundation. The foundation’s mission is to make cloud native computing ubiquitous by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects.

* Out of 30+ projects, the most well known is Kubernetes. The maturity level of a project indicates the velocity and adoption. There are 3 graduated projects (including Kubernetes), 17 incubating, and 12 sandbox projects. 

* The CNCF organises the biggest conference in this space, KubeCon + CloudNativeCon.  8000 attended the last conference, and the next one is 20-23 May in Barcelona. The Call For Proposals (CfP) closes one week on Friday, so get your talk proposals in soon!
