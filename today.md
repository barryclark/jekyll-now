## 1. The Evolution of Web Layout
### Learning Objectives
- Describe responsive design and what problem it tries to solve.
- List the physical and software characteristics that are unique to mobile devices.
- Discuss the relative market share of mobile web traffic vs desktop web traffic.
- Discuss the relative screen time spent on mobile apps vs mobile web sites.

### Terminology
<dl>
  <dt>Desktop vs Mobile Web</dt>
  <dd>A comparison of web traffic between desktop and mobile platforms.</dd>
  <dt>Native App vs Web App Screen Time</dt>
  <dd>A comparison of average time spent "on-screen" between web and native phone applications.</dd>
</dl>

### Activity: How is mobile unique?
You will work in groups of 3 or 4 for this activity. Beyond the obvious difference in screen size, discuss how mobile is different than desktop:
- What hardware features do mobile phones have compared to traditional desktop systems?
- Do users have the same goals when browsing on a phone vs browsing on a laptop or desktop? If not, what's different?

## 2. Common Mobile Design Patterns

</dl>

### Activity: Dev Tools vs Mobile Devices
You will work in groups of 3 or 4 for this activity.

Compare and contrast the visual appearance of a mobile website between
1. The virtual mobile simulator in FireFox Dev Tools, and
2. A real mobile device.

Select a representative from each group to present a summary of your findings to the rest of the class.

## 3. Performance Audits
You will work in groups of 3 or 4 for this activity.

After a short demo from your instructor, evaluate your favourite sites using the Performance tab in Chrome Developer Tools.
- Which sites score the lowest?
- Which score the highest?
