I’m often asked what software and hardware I’m using. This page attempts to answers that question.

## Hardware

I switched from living in ‘Microsoft Windows Land’ since the early 90’s to the Mac in 2013. I wish I’d done it sooner because the integration between the devices is wonderful.

- Mac Mini - From late 2012
- MacBook Pro – From early 2013
- iPhone 8 Plus – Great handheld computer, plus it has a phone
- iPad Pro 10.5″ – with Apple keyboard cover and Apple Pencil
- <a name="a↑"></a>I added a pen clip from the “Bullet” Fischer Space Pen to the Apple Pencil<sup>[<a href="#a↓">a</a>]</sup>. The Apple Pencil is finally a real digital replacement for a paper pad and pen. The iPad Pro 10.5 is the best tablet I’ve ever used, to the point where it is my primary device
