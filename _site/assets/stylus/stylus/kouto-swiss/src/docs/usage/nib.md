### Using nib with kouto swiss

**kouto swiss** is highly inspired by [nib](http://visionmedia.github.io/nib/).

As kouto swiss and nib shares some functions & mixins names, **it's not a great idea** to use nib and kouto swiss together.

In simple terms : importing **kouto swiss** *after* **nib** will break some of nib's features, and importing **nib** *after* **kouto swiss** will break some of kouto swiss' features.

kouto swiss has been coded in the way to provide a complete *alternative* to nib.

If you look after some features of nib that you don't find in kouto swiss, create an [issue topic](https://github.com/krkn/kouto-swiss/issues) to request it, or, even better if you can, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/krkn/kouto-swiss/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
