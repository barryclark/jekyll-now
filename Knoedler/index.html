Michel Knoedler, the founder of Knoedler Gallery, was originally sent to New York to establish a branch of Paris’ <a href="http://primo.getty.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=detailsTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=GETTY_ALMA21134399430001551&indx=3&recIds=GETTY_ALMA21134399430001551&recIdxs=2&elementId=2&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&frbrVersion=&dscnt=0&vl(65062710UI1)=all_items&scp.scps=scope%3A%28GETTY_ROSETTA%29%2Cscope%3A%28GETTY_ALMA%29&frbg=&tab=all_gri&dstmp=1430519809547&srt=rank&mode=Basic&&dum=true&vl(1UIStartWith0)=contains&vl(21781791UI0)=any&vl(freeText0)=goupil&vid=GRI"target="_blank">Goupil et Cie Gallery</a>. However, he quickly realized the potential of the American market and decided to capitalize on it, buying out the New York branch after ten years. The newly formed Knoedler Gallery changed gears from specializing in French Salon paintings, the crux of the industry at that point, to branching out into the relatively new field of Old Masters and American artists. With notable clients such as the Astors, the Vanderbilts, J.P. Morgan, Henry Clay Frick, and others, Knoedler <a href="http://archives2.getty.edu:8082/xtf/view?docId=ead/2012.M.54/2012.M.54.xml;chunk.id=ref1414;brand=default"target="_blank">salesbooks</a> read like a veritable who’s who of late 19th and early 20th century American society. It’s hard to overestimate the influence the gallery had on the burgeoning art market in New York and throughout the country. While Knoedler was not the only gallery changing the landscape of the art market (see also <a href="http://primo.getty.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=detailsTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=GETTY_ALMA21123232950001551&indx=1&recIds=GETTY_ALMA21123232950001551&recIdxs=0&elementId=0&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&frbrVersion=&dscnt=1&fctN=facet_local2&rfnGrp=1&query=any%2Ccontains%2Cduveen&scp.scps=scope%3A%28GETTY_ROSETTA%29%2Cscope%3A%28GETTY_ALMA%29&fctV=GRI+Special+Collections&tab=all_gri&dstmp=1430519638299&highlight=true&mode=Basic&displayField=all&rfnGrpCounter=1&vl(21781791UI0)=any&vl(freeText0)=duveen&vid=GRI&institution=01GRI&search_scope=ALMA_DIGITAL&vl(1UIStartWith0)=contains&queryTemp=duveen&group=GUEST&y=0&x=0."target="_blank">Duveen</a>), they were easily the major supplier to the United States. Their records constitute the history of taste, the art market, collecting, patronage, artists and works of art, and were a major coup when acquired by the Getty Research Institute after the closure of the gallery in the early 2010’s. Previously, the archive was housed in the New York office, inaccessible and not widely available for study. Once acquired, the GRI quickly set about processing and readying the archive for digitization. As of March 2015, six out of the eleven series of the archive were online, free and open to perusal. </p>
