> ### The Case
>
> Once when Paichang gave a series of talks, a certain old man was always there listening together with the monks. When they left, he would leave too. One day, however, he remained behind. Paichang asked him, "Who are you, standing here before me?"
>
> The old man replied, "I am not a human being. In the far distant past, in the time of Kasyapa Buddha, I was head priest at this mountain. One day a monk asked me, 'Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' I replied, 'Such a person does not fall under the law of cause and effect.' With this I was reborn five hundred times as a fox. Please say a turning word for me and release me from the body of a fox."
>
> He then asked Paichang, "Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?"
>
> Paichang said, "Such a person does not evade the law of cause and effect."
>
> Hearing this, the old man immediately was enlightened. Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox. The body is on the other side of this mountain. I wish to make a request of you. Please, Abbot, perform my funerals as for a priest."
>
> Paichang had a head monk strike the signal board and inform the assembly that after the noon meal there would be a funeral service for a priest. The onks talked about this in wonder. "All of us are well. There is no one in the morgue. What does the teacher mean?"
>
> After the meal, Paichang led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the mountain. And there, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then performed the ceremony of cremation. That evening he took the high seat before his assembly and told the monks the whole story.
>
> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given the right answer each time he was asked a question -- what would have happened then?"
>
> Paichang said, "Just step here closer, and I'll tell you." Huang-po went up to Paichang and slapped him in the face.
>
> Paichang clapped his hands and laughed, saying, "I thought the Barbarian had a red beard, but here is a red-bearded Barbarian."
>
> ### Wu-men's comment
> "Not falling under the law of cause and effect." Why should this prompt five hundred lives as a fox? "Not evading the law of cause and effect." Why should this prompt a return a human life? If you have the single eye of realization, you will appreciate how old Paichang lived five hundred lives as a fox as lives of grace.

> ### Wu-men's verse
> Not falling, not evading--  
> two faces of the same die.  
> Not evading, not falling--  
> a thousand mistakes, ten thousand mistakes.

## Notes

This case can be found as:
- Case 2 of Gateless Barrier
- Case 8 of Book of Serenity,
- Case 102 of Dogen's Shinji Shobogenzo.

_"Such a person does not evade the law of cause and effect"_ is elsewhere rendered as:
- _"The law of cause and effect cannot be obscured."_ (Koun Yamada Roshi, The Gateless Gate, 1979)
- _"He is not blind to cause and effect."_ (Thomas Cleary, Book of Serenity, Case 8, 2005)
- _"He is not deluded about cause and effect"_ (J.C. Cleary, Wumen's Gate, 2005)
- _"Do not be unclear about cause and effect."_ (Gudo Nishijima, Master Dogen's Shinji Shobogenzo, Book II case 2, 2003)
- _"Don't ignore cause and effect"_ (Kazuaki Tanahashi, John Daido Loori, The True Dharma Eye case 102, 2005)

Book of Serenity Case 8 has some comments/notes/interjections following the case. Here's a few:
- _"The old man was enlightened at these words - Fox drool is still there."_
- _"For five hundred lives he couldn't do a thing - If he had known what would happen today, he'd regret not being careful to begin with."_
- _"I fell into a wild fox body for five hundred lives - You said one doesn't fall into cause and effect."_

# Prompts

_The following are my own only. They are not part of the case in any way. I hope they can be useful to you. They are organized in "reads": a specific topic for the investigation of this koan._

## A read about being wrong all the time

> One day, however, he remained behind. Paichang __asked him__,

Hu ho...

> "__Who are you__, standing here before me?"  

Don't reply!

> The old man __replied__...

Oh no, you did!

> __I__ am not a human being...

Starting with "I", not a great start for an answer.

What does this reply indicate? The old man indeed seems to be the object of the law of cause and effect.

Would he answer __this__ question if he was enlightened?

> One day __a monk asked me__, 'Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' ...

Hu ho... don't tell me you replied to that one too?

> ... __I replied__ ...

Oh no, you did it again!

Someone asking you a question does not mean you have to answer.

> 'Such a person does not fall under the law of cause and effect.'

A wrong question leads to a wrong answer.

> With this I was reborn five hundred times as a fox.

But... _"You said one doesn't fall into cause and effect."_

> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given __the right answer__ each time he was asked a question -- what would have happened then?"

That's a trap!

> Paichang said, "Just step here closer, and I'll tell you." Huang-po went up to Paichang and slapped him in the face.

It seems better to just not answer anything at all.


## A read about doctrines

> Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox. The body is __on the other side of this mountain__.

I bet the other side of __this__ mountain is facing north.

> After the meal, Paichang led the monks to the foot of a rock __on the far side of the mountain__. And there, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then __performed the ceremony of cremation__.

Old Paichang does not belong to the same side of the mountain, still he deserves to receive the ritual owed to a priest.

> "In the far distant past, in the time of Kasyapa Buddha, I was head priest at this mountain. One day a monk asked me, 'Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' I replied, '__Such a person does not fall under the law of cause and effect.__' With this I was __reborn five hundred times__ as a fox. Please say a turning word for me and release me from the body of a fox."
>
> He then asked Paichang, "Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?"
>
> Paichang said, "__Such a person does not evade the law of cause and effect.__"
>
> Hearing this, the old man __immediately was enlightened__. Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox."

So, on *this* side of the mountain, you can get enlightened suddenly. Looks like old Paichang has been stuck on the other side for a long time.

> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given __the right answer__ each time he was asked a question -- what would have happened then?"

Could you really do that? Answer correctly to this hard question even the very first time you're being asked? Is answering wrongly a natural step for someone on the path to enlightenment?

> Paichang said, "Just step here closer, and I'll tell you." Huang-po went up to Paichang and __slapped him in the face__.

What kind of action would prompt such a reward?

> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given the right answer __each time__ he was asked a question -- __what would have happened then__?"

How many times does one have to answer that question to finally reach enlightenment?


## A read about the ritual

> Hearing this, the old man immediately was enlightened. Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox. The body is on the other side of this mountain. I wish to make a request of you. __Please__, Abbot, __perform my funerals as for a priest__."

Ritual and liturgy, is that the answer to the question?

Why does old Paichang even request a funeral? What's the purpose of it?

> "There, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then performed __the ceremony of cremation__."

Why would there be anything to do with the fox's body? What does it __do__ to cremate it? What does it accomplish?


## A read about cause and effects

> Once when Paichang gave a series of talks, a certain old man was always there listening together with the monks. When they left, he would leave too. __One day__, however, __he remained behind.__

What happened that day? What came to be? What was different about that day? What emerged so that __this__ day old Paichang went to the master?

> __When they left, he would leave too__.

He was going with the stream.

> __One day, however__, he remained behind.

There the stream meets a boulder, causing the water to stop for a moment.

> "Not falling under the law of cause and effect." Why should __this__ prompt five hundred lives as a fox? "Not evading the law of cause and effect." Why should __this__ prompt a return a human life? If you have the single eye of realization, you will appreciate how old Paichang lived five hundred lives as a fox as lives of grace.

What has old Paichang done to receive this fruit and live five hundred lives as a fox? What has he done to be released from it today? Why should __this__ prompt five hundred lives as a fox?

> The old man replied, "I am not a human being. __In the far distant past__, in the time of Kasyapa Buddha, __I was__ head priest at this mountain.

This is so far in the past, how could there be anything left from the "I" that __was__.  

> "Please say a __turning point__ for me [...] Hearing this, the old man __immediately was enlightened__."

> Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox."

No you're not. _"Fox drool is still there."_

> What if he had given __the right answer__ each time he was asked a question -- what would have happened then?"

Yes. What would have happened then? What **then**?

What is the effect of **this** cause? Is there any even?
