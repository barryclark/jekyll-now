As many excellent apps you will find here, as many people probably miss their personal favorite. This is just a little collection of elementary applications that are either waiting to be revived, only live in the form of mockups or even only in the heads of wishful thinkers. 

If you are a developer please squash some [elementary bugs](http://bugs.launchpad.net/elementary) or help out [other developers]({{ site.baseurl }}apps/) first. Or do you own thing: Any item on this list is a good place to start your own elementary project. 

Name | Generic | Info
---|---|---
[Lingo](https://launchpad.net/lingo-dictionary) (abandoned) | Dictionary App | Official elementary application. Integration with a web-based dictionary like [dict.cc](http://dict.cc) could help with having big and updated database.
[Dexter](https://launchpad.net/dexter-contacts) (abandoned) | Contact Management | Official elementary application. Should allow syncing with contacts in cloud (Google, Microsoft, Apple, self-hosted).
[AppCenter](https://launchpad.net/appcenter) (in-development) | Software Store | Official elementary app. Only included because people often ask: This in development, but it is not expected to be finished before elementary 0.4 Loki. 
*unnamed* | Office Suite | By popular demand, but probably an undertaking as big as the whole elementary project. [Writer]({{ site.baseurl }}Writer/) is the only currently existing app that could be part of this, a spreadsheet and presentation app only exist as mockups so far. 
*unnamed* | Two-factor code generator | A generator for two-factor authentication codes similar to WinAuth
*Indicator Night* | Indicator | An indicator adjusting the screen color to time of day, like f.lux. Maybe also include the option to switch to dark them depending on time of day.
*unnamed* | Font Manager | A good font manager, better than NexusFont. Include downloading from free font resources directly from inside the app, provide categoriziation via library data
*unnamed* | Multi-messenger | Multi-messenger, basically Pidgin (pretty good) only with native integration (GTK3, headerbars, ...)
*Indicator Share* | Indicator | Similar to what Microsoft could have done with the share button in charms: You select something, click on the indicator or use a shortcut, and can immediately share it via services (in online accounts and specified in settings) in one click. The app detects the type of the selection (image, text, link...) and tries to share appropriately
*unnamed* | Archive manager | elementary needs something to replace `file roller` that looks out of place
*unnamed* | Process viewer | There is no easy to view (and sometimes kill) the running processes. Being able to view the CPU and memory load would be also nice
*Elementary shortcut* | System | A nice way to learn the elementary shortcuts. ![img](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/72b303c2c0340d0777f6e2031f6f8547b4524a33/687474703a2f2f666330312e64657669616e746172742e6e65742f667337312f662f323031322f3332322f622f302f6b6579626f6172645f73686f7274637574735f62795f62617373756c7472612d64356c6536366f2e706e67) Source [bassultra](http://bassultra.deviantart.com/art/Keyboard-Shortcuts-Cheatsheet-338264016)

As you see, there is always work to do. 

If there is another app for elementary you are missing desperately, feel free to [file an issue at GitHub](https://github.com/quassy/elementary-apps/issues/new) to get it added to the list (or *just* create it yourself).
