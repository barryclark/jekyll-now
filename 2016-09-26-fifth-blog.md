Hello fellow bloggers! 
Well this week was a pretty chill week in Humanities class! We had some “fun” learning about text analysis and how to read through longer texts as quickly as possible. Doing that demo in class on how to write a program that can do word analysis was pretty scary though. I was so lost, and I had no idea what we were doing. However, that was probably one of the most interesting things I’ve experienced so far in the class, and pretty useful as well. It might seem impossible to read through a long text quickly and understand everything you just read, but it is if you perform this method. With this, you’ll get an understanding of at least the most important details in the text. 
Text analysis is definitely useful when you’re reading through a passage quickly. An important thing is to find out what the reason for the author writing the passage is, and what the passage is about. Once those two are figured out, finding out the rest is a breeze! It was also interesting learning about how computers can count words using the tool. It’s definitely worth using for research purposes and is very helpful. Seeing how much of a word appears in the text can possibly even tell you something about the text before you even read it! In other words, text analysis is definitely worth learning. It’s surprising to see the outcome of everything.
