### UNet Foreground Image Segmentation

<img width="800" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-21 at 17 24 19" src="https://github.com/KayO-GH/kayo-gh.github.io/assets/18174012/601f9242-fdc7-4ba1-a36b-ab8649316cc8">

A TensorFlow project from 2020 using a modified UNet autoencoder architecture with MobileNetV2 weights to perform transfer learning for foreground image segmentation. The original usecase was polyp segmentation from colonoscopy images, but this was repurposed for foreground segmentation of everyday objects.
