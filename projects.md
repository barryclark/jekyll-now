    <p>Here are a few of my professional & personal Web projects that are currently being used (and worked on) in the real world. Many more smaller recent projects are available on my <a href="http:///www.github.com/stevechendc">Github</a> expressing my active interest in learning new technologies. </p>

      <h3 class="major">KaBOOM! Map of Play v2</h3>

      <article style="text-align:center">
        <a href="http://mapofplay.kaboom.org" class="image" target="blank_"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/z6gDZw0.png?2" alt="" /></a>
        <p> KaBOOM's Map of Play is the largest playground locator in the world with 50,000+ unique visitors monthly, a RESTful API and mobile apps that use it. KaBOOM! a national non-profit that builds playgrounds for kids and promote plays in low-income adverse communities.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left"> My role in this project was to spearhead the rewrite of the backend implementing new features, testing, database design, integration with multiple libraries and gems. The entire goal of this project was to move away from their unopen legacy app riddled with incompatible technologies, unsolvable bugs, lack of tests, and general code smell due to 3rd party developers. All work was done during my Software Engineering internship at KaBOOM! within an agile team with daily pair programming and code reviews with the software engineering manager to ensure ideal specs were met. Key skills used included Test driven development, Continuous integration,  Job processing, and git workflow. </p>

        <a href="http://www.steamfriend.me" class="image" target="blank_"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9oysHdO.png" alt="" /></a>
        <p> Steamfriend.me is a gaming social networking service that provides gamers with the ability to be matched up with other gamers based on games they own on their Steam account with the ability to rate matches.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">In this project I learned how to build a full Web Application within a 3-person team, increase productivity through implementation of Agile, and pitch it to 150+ members of the South Florida Tech community. Built with Ruby on Rails as the backend, PostgreSQL to manage database, Heroku for deployment, Github for Version control, CSS, HTML, and various libraries/gems such as animate.css for animations, omniauth-steam gem for authentication of users, in-conjunction with data parsed from the Steam API.</p>

        <a href="http://muralr.herokuapp.com/" class="image" target="blank_"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KyS4djv.png" alt="" /></a>

        <p> Muralr is a civic crowdsourced mural uploading website featuring murals from the arts district in Ft. Lauderdale with basic Rails CRUD and search functionality. Idea originated from the Code4FortLauderdale, a civic software development meetup group.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left">When creating Muralr I learned how to work within a remote 3 person team within a weekend time period, develop a MVP, and present it to 100+ Wyncode students' friends & family. Muralr was developed using Ruby on Rails as the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, Bootstrap for a responsive design, HTML, and CSS.</p>
