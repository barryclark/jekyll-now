I"!<p>After having spent around 14 hours in Italy we started making our way towards Postojna (â€œPos-toy-naâ€), about an hour over the Italian/Slovenian border. The idea was to try and spend a couple hours in Trieste on the way over, get one more fix of that sweet sweet Italian coffee and maybe check out the Roman ruins before moving on but a bit of misinformation from the internet (Iâ€™m shocked and appalled that the internet could be wrong, whoâ€™d have thought?!) meant we had maybe 45 mins to eat and make a connection to our next bus.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A train and 2 bus trips later we found ourselves in Postojna, our introduction to the land that loves to jam the letter J randomly into words presumably to see how dumb tourists sound trying to pronounce them.</p>

<p>Postojna, Iâ€™m informed, is home to Slovenijaâ€™s (again with the â€˜Jâ€™s!) number 1 <strong>and</strong> number 2 tourist attractions, being that of the Postojna caves and the castle built into the side of a cliff/cave. First off we headed down to the caves which was actually pretty sweet to see. The cave system was very extensive, to the point that we went on a 2km train ride through the caves just to get to the point where we could take a proper walking tour.</p>

<p>I took a few photos but the limited light and the constant â€œno photos!â€ â€œkeep moving!â€ or â€œno flash!â€ being barked at the group by a trailing tour guide prevented me from getting (m)any good shots.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a constant temperature of around 8 degrees celsius year-round in there, and was weird to have gone into there from outside where it was closer to the mid-twenties. At the end of the tour we get guided through the â€˜concert hallâ€™ which is quite literally what they call it, except itâ€™s a cave. Up the back there was a bunch of mock-up graves with a little gremlin type thing.</p>

</p>

<p>I tried asking the guide what the deal with this was, to which the response I received was pretty much along the lines of â€˜eh, itâ€™s just some crap useless art installationâ€™. Maybe not in so many words, but yeh.</p>

<p>The caves were pretty damn sweet, but now it was time to check out Sloveniaâ€™s number 2 tourist attraction. We didnâ€™t go inside, but it was a pretty sweet looking building.</p>

<p>After our short stay in Postojna we moved on to Bled, a sleepy lakeside town tucked away in a valley which I could explain but I guess I could just let the pictures do the talking.</p>

<p>You donâ€™t really do much in Bled, you kind of laze about, take in the scenery and know that life is probably 3 million times sweeter just being here looking at the scenery than wherever you are right now, whatever it is you are doing. Sorry, but it did rule.</p>

<p>We went rowingâ€¦</p>

<p>From Bled it was on to Ljubljana (â€œLoo-blah-nahâ€â€¦ or â€œle-jew-bull-jar-naâ€ as we were calling it) for another overnight stop as we were flying out of there. It also had an â€˜old townâ€™ district that kept us busy for a few hours as we explored it .Dave and I kept an eye out for points of interest, the guide maps recommending the castle and the Roman wall. The castle was what youâ€™d expect, nothing bad, but the Roman wallâ€¦ well yeah, I was a little disappointed.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p>

<p>They even restored the pyramid that stands over the gate at the Roman wallâ€¦ with freaking cinderblock! Seriously, theyâ€™re not even trying anymore. Slovenia, I are disappoint.Â  and sorry.</p>

<p>The wall aside though, itâ€™s been great fun through here. Slovenija, youâ€™ve been rad, but now itâ€™s time for Parijs, Frajnce.</p>
