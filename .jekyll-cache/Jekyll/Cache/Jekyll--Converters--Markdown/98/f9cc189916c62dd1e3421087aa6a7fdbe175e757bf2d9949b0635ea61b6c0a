I"™<p>Went for a quick ride out to Roskildeâ€¦ Didnâ€™t know if there was much there aside from a Viking Museum (pretty badass in itself, so naturally I had to check it out), and after having been there I can confirm no, no there isnâ€™t much there aside from a Viking Museum. As such, I have only 3 photos to show you</p>

<p>I could have posted more photos, but it would be like â€œoooh, a viking wreckâ€¦ oooh another viking wreck. OH MY GOD ITâ€™S YET ANOTHER GODDAMN VIKING WRECK!!â€</p>

<p>Oh, I also learnt that â€˜vikingâ€™ was a term for â€˜pirates of the northâ€™â€¦ Strictly speaking they overwhelmingly werenâ€™t into piracy (was a bit hard back then without CD burners or Rapidshare and Megaupload), but being pirates of some sort makes them completely badass.</p>
