<p>Last week, when our class explored the Princeton University
Library digital archives,
I was excited to see what Firestoneâ€™s special collections had to offer. I
decided to look at the
<a href="/&quot;https://dpul.princeton.edu/pudl0017&quot;">Western Americana Collection</a>,
since I knew I wanted a source that was written in English. If you scroll the
collection, youâ€™ll undoubtedly notice the many photographs and newspaper
clippings. But I was interested in the many journals and letters handwritten
by those who had traveled West during the 19th Century. I clicked through a
lot of journalsâ€“ I was specifically hoping to find one written by a woman.
Although I didnâ€™t find that, I did come across
<a href="/&quot;https://dpul.princeton.edu/pudl0017/catalog/qr46r491g&quot;">one journal</a>
that intrigued me more than the rest.</p>
