I"ñ<p>Colorado. Apparently it actually means something. Apparently the place was discovered, settled, or at the very least named by a bunch of Spanish dudes. A bunch of incredibly unimaginative Spanish dudes, for they decided that upon discovering the land of red rocks and red soil, that it would be an amazing idea to call the place â€œColor Redâ€. The Spanish can come up with the holiest of all foods â€“ Churros â€“ and the best name they can come up with for this place is â€˜Coloradoâ€™?</p>
