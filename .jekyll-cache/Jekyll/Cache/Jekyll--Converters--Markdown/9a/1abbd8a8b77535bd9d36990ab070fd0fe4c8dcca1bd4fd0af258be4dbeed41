<p>I am interested in exploring private forms of communication (diaries, letters, etc.) from the <a href="https://dpul.princeton.edu/pudl0017">Western Americana Collection</a>. In particular, I am curious about womenâ€™s perspectives on exploration and settlement in the Western United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Most of the written materials in the collection were produced by men, especially those surrounding exploration. I found one <a href="https://figgy.princeton.edu/catalog/d622ff36-1c99-4991-81a6-4885e9f23107">manuscript</a> (pictured below) written by Nellie Martin Wade titled â€œThrough Interior Alaska on Horseback and the Scenic Coast Routeâ€ on her exploration of Alaska in the early 20th century. Notably, Wade includes in the title page that she is the â€œfirst woman to explore the Great Shushitna Valley and the Mt. McKinley Range.â€</p>
