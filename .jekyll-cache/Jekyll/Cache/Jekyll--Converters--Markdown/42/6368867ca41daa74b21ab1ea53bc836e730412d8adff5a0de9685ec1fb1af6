I"Ë<p>There have been a ton of times during this trip that Blister by Jimmy Eat World keeps popping into my head, the lyrics â€œhow long would it take me to walk across the United States all aloneâ€ seeming to fit in rather perfectly with this unplanned journey Iâ€™ve been doing. Seeing places by foot is always the best way in my opinion, and with the miles Iâ€™ve clocked up lately I feel like I pretty much have walked the United States â€“ all alone â€“ and evidently the answer is a month. And it just hit me, I can now cross another item off that bucket list, completing a road trip from coast to coast in the USA, albeit in a much different manner and itinerary to how I originally imagined and intended.</p>
