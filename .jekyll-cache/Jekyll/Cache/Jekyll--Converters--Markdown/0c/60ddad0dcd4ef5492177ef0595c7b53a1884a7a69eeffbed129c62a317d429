I"ˆ<p>Hello, and welcome to HUM 331/HIS 336. This semester weâ€™re going to undertake a journey 
through the history of communications technologies, from ancient Sumer to the modern 
Twitterverse. In addition to this journey through the past, youâ€™ll also be learning how 
our latest communications technologyâ€“digital technologyâ€“is shaping how historians 
engage with the past. This is our course website where youâ€™ll post digital assignments 
and your final project to share with your classmates. Youâ€™ll access this site via our 
class repository in GitHub, which means youâ€™ll need to register for a GitHub account 
(theyâ€™re free) if you havenâ€™t already. If you donâ€™t know what a GitHub is, donâ€™t 
worryâ€“weâ€™ll go over first steps in class. For more information on the course and to view
the syllabus, navigate to the Course Description page. Looking forward to a great semester!</p>
