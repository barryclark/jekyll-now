I"ñ<p>â€˜DING!â€™<br />
Like Pavlovâ€™s dogs and the bell, I get a little excited when I hear the bell of my phone, but instead of a fresh meal Iâ€™m waiting for the email to finish downloading. I donâ€™t know what exactly gives me the urge to check it right then and there when more often than not itâ€™s some newsletter I signed up to years ago, a Nigerian prince that needs my help to recover lost money, or some generous stranger offering to â€œENL@RG3 Y0UR P3N15!â€ but this was different.</p>
