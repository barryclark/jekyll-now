I"º<p>Creedence Clearwater Revival has been spinning round in my head whilst in New Orleans, particularly on my first day when I went on a swamp tour and went through the bayous of southern â€œLoeze-yannaâ€â€¦ Bayou, for those of you who donâ€™t know, is the 4th word in the title of the first track of Creedenceâ€™s <em>Bayou Country</em>, which as you can see, also has â€˜Bayouâ€™ in itâ€™s title. Oh yeh, itâ€™s also a meandering river. Or at least thatâ€™s the gist I got from the tour guide, but with the sweet sounds of John Fogerty singing â€œdoot doot doot looking out my back doorâ€ swirling around my head, Iâ€™m sure you can understand why I may have found it hard to pay attention.</p>
