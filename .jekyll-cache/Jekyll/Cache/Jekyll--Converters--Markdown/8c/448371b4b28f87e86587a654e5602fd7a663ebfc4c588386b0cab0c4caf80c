<p>Damien rocked up on Monday afternoon and man was it great to catch up with him again. Itâ€™s been about a month and a half since Iâ€™ve seen him since heâ€™s been travelling all over the place.</p>

<p>We quickly made our way out into the city and went straight to the Tower of London. This place was so awesome I wanted to shoot myself in the face. <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/europe%202010/IMG_1901.jpg">With a crossbow</a>. Donâ€™t get me wrong, castles are pretty badass with their cache of swords, <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/europe%202010/IMG_1903.jpg">canons</a>, crossbows and castle-y kind of thingsâ€¦ But a line that takes about 50 mins to see some ridiculously expensive jewellery, plates and other assorted useless royal artefacts is not so badass.</p>

<p>I think one of the highlights was the Scaffold Site. How good is scaffolding?</p>

<p>So after Â£17 and a couple hours of my life I decided Iâ€™d make sure to get my moneys worth and make off with the Crown Jewels</p>

<p>After this Damien and I went on a self-guided tour of the city, along the Thames (and spotted Matt Bellamy from Muse), past the London Eye, over to Big Benjamin/Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey and over to Buckingham Palace. Walking along in the park we stopped to check out the squirrels, <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/europe%202010/IMG_1910.jpg">they really liked Damien</a>. Probably after nuts.</p>

<p>Because I somehow missed it last time I was in London, hereâ€™s a picture of Trafalgar Square:</p>

</p>

<p>We also met up with Ash, that was pretttttttty, pretty, pretty, pretty good. Sheâ€™s now living in London, working as editor of the Australian Timesâ€¦ Drinks and dinner with her, and weâ€™ll be catching up with her on her birthday this Sunday night at Rage Against The Machine.</p>

<p>â€¦Tuesdayâ€¦</p>

<p>Went up to Camden markets for a bit of a geeze, only to discover they donâ€™t open till really late in the morning, so we took a quick look around the area, <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/europe%202010/IMG_1913.jpg">cuddled some horses</a>, and then headed for the train station to go to Brighton.</p>

<p>Brighton is a pretty rad little place. We made tracks for the beach, first time seeing a stoney/pebbly beach. Didnâ€™t stop us from <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/europe%202010/IMG_1922.jpg">catching some rays</a>. It was such <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/europe%202010/IMG_1923.jpg">a beautiful day</a> for it. Goddamn overcast and rainy.</p>

<p>Went for a stroll up to <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/europe%202010/IMG_1934.jpg">Brighton Pier</a>, full of amusements. It was kinda bizarre, <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/europe%202010/IMG_1929.jpg">rides</a> aside it appeared to be encouraging kids to gambleâ€¦ so of course we <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/europe%202010/IMG_1927.jpg">bet on the horses</a>. I won about 40pâ€¦ I may have made a loss or five before that though.</p>

<p>Also I saw <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/europe%202010/IMG_1930.jpg">Oasis</a> while there. Pretty cool.</p>

</p>

<p>Walking further along the beach we came across Crazy Golf.Â  Â£2.50 for 18 holes, thatâ€™s a bargain in my book, and of course that meant we had to go get our putt-putt on. Donâ€™t let the â€˜Crazyâ€™ in the games name fool you, this game was serious business:</p>

<p>It was so serious I think we lost track of score. Pretty sure I won.</p>

<p>Get back to the hostel to get ready for the nightâ€™s Alkaline Trio / Set Your Goals / Attack! Attack! Show and maybe have a few pre-bevvies, check the intrawebs for a few minutes and discover GALLOWS ARE PLAYING A LAST MINUTE SURPRISE SET! Pretty much lost it right then and there. The best part was Damien and I bought tix to the show a couple months back just for something to do and only knew Alkaline Trio were playingâ€¦ but two of our favourite bands ended up playing the bill. Best value tickets ever.</p>

<p>Got to the venue, partied with Damien and Tim and had a tip top night.</p>

<p>Currently in the air somewhere over France on my way to meet up with the lovely people I like to call Mum and Dad. Pretty excited to hang out for a few chill days in Trieste with them.</p>
