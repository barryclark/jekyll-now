I"¯<p>Travelling on a budget is such a vicious cycle. After the <a href="http://happyseizure.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/the-official-greyhound-stats-after-1-month/" title="Bus travel">two months</a> I spent practically living on busses in the USA and Canada I swore Iâ€™d never do it again. Then when time comes to make another travel decision I tell myself â€œyouâ€™ve done it all before, whatâ€™s just one more night on a busâ€?</p>
