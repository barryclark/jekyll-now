## Frequently asked questions

#### Can we host an event at our office?

Our events are at the same venue each month, so we aren't looking for venue hosts for now.

#### Can we run an event on a specific day?

We plan events 6-12 months ahead, so unfortunately we can't add extra events to the schedule.

#### Are we listed as the pizza / beer sponsor?

As pizza and beer are more than any individual contribution, we order catering ourselves and thank all sponsors equally.

#### Can we bring swag and a banner? (N/A for virtual events)

You can display a banner inside the room, just bring it on the evening. Please ship swag to this address a week in advance and let us know when to expect arrival:

> Sainsbury's Courier Desk  
> c/o Simon Perry, Cloud Native London  
> 60 Fetter Lane  
> Holborn  
> London EC4A 1AA  

If you need a table on the evening, email Simon.Perry2@sainsburys.co.uk.

#### Can we sponsor as a recruitment agency?

We work with one recruitment agency at a time, so we won't add more until further notice.

#### Can we share our event with your group?

[Promote your events and offers](/cloudnativelondon/share)

#### What if I have further questions?

Contact organisers@cloudnativelon.com.
