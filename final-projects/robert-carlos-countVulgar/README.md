Project by Robert Judka and Carlos Lopez

Takes Top 100 songs list (billboard.com) from 1960 to 2015 and gets the lyrics from all possible songs and saves them into song-data.json.

Finds various vulgar words (as defined by various banned words list from the internet) and collects data on how the use of vulgar language has changed over the years.
