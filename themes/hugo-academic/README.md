### Install with web browser

[Install Academic with Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart)
  * One-click install of Academic creates an `academic-kickstart` repository in your GitHub or GitLab account
  * Netlify will provide you with a customizable URL to access your new site, [or get your own domain](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/domain/)
  * Shortly after editing content in your repository, your site will automatically update
  * Optionally, to edit your site in a [Markdown editor](https://www.typora.io) on your computer, perform the steps in the [*Install with Git*](#install-with-git) section below

### Install with Git

Prerequisites:

* [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Download and install Hugo Extended v0.63.1+](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install)

Install:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart#fork-destination-box) the *Academic Kickstart* repository to create a new website
   * If you already created your site with **Netlify**, then skip this step
2. Clone your fork to your computer with Git, replacing `sourcethemes` in the command below with your GitHub username: 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git My_Website
    ```
    
3. Initialize the theme:

    ```bash
    cd My_Website
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

### Install with ZIP

Prerequisites:

* [Download and install Hugo Extended v0.63.1+](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install)

Install:

2. [Download](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/archive/master.zip) and extract the *Academic theme* files from the `hugo-academic-master` folder to the `themes/academic/` folder in *Academic Kickstart*

### Install with RStudio

[Install Academic with RStudio](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/#install-with-rstudio)

## Demo content

For inspiration, refer to the [Markdown content](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite) which powers the [Demo](https://academic-demo.netlify.com/).

If you wish to initialise your site with the demo content, copy the contents of the `themes/academic/exampleSite/` folder to your website root folder, overwriting existing files if necessary. The `exampleSite` folder contains an example config file and content to help you get started. The following command can be used to accomplish this:

```bash
cp -av themes/academic/exampleSite/* .
```
