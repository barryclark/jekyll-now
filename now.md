Summer is coming to a close and I've had a great time out on the lake. I had a lot of chances to surf this summer as my sons are less interested in it.

I finished my second presidential biography (John Adams) and am reading some fiction to take a break.

I started riding bike again after a 20 year hiatus and we purchased a Peloton. I am trying to get in better shape.

My main evening project has been writing here at johnuhri.com. I have a few side projects I'm working on, but they get sporadic attention at best. The code I do write is much more fun as a hobby rather than my first responsibility at work.

Currently, I'm learning all of the 46 presidents in order. It's part of a goal to read a biography of each president.

Ski season is done for the year, at least for me. Now I'm looking forward to summer and getting the boat out on the water.
