Day-to-day: Snr Front-end Engineer at Kainos in Birmingham.

### Projects 👨🏼‍💻

Recently finished working with Cambridge-based Telensa, building a front-end for their [Urban Data Project](https://urbandataproject.org) subscriber platform, and Angular data-visualisation project.

Was lucky enough to visit Gdansk-based colleagues on this project which was a fantasic learning and team-building experience. 

Currently experiencing something of a departure from my normal front-end work by making a utility in Node to parse a JSON schema into ES6.

Now involved in the early-stages of a complex discovery for improving our development processes. 
It's exposing me to new aspects of software development outside of front-end which initially makes me feel out of place, but am taking it as an opportunity to build my resilience, and a great chance to learn more across an application.

### Local Tech Events
Attended [Notts Agile](https://www.meetup.com/NottAgile/) this month where we learned about building effective teams and healthy, safe development cultures. [Tweet >](https://twitter.com/MartinoNotts/status/1187136543833636865)
Quite a few references and ideas from this meetup around team culture:
- [Atlassian Rules of Engagement](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/rules-of-engagement)
- Understand how to interact with others by understanding personality types: [Speak First Animal Quiz](https://www.speak-first.com/which-animal-are-you/) (I'm mostly Owl).
- [Understand your resilience](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/resilience-quiz.htm)

### Health & fitness
Recently recovered from a knee injury which kept me off running for what felt like an age! I did discover road riding in the meantime - the [road bike](https://www.instagram.com/p/B089DcdllOtNO7r7JsU7I3kSemzxmgSqQimrD00/) became my new favourite thing! Getting back on the running again now though! 🚀

Bouldering at 2-3 times a week 🧗

### Thinking about
- Being deliberate with how I spend time. Having systematically cutting out much 'low value' time sinks/media, there is much time available. I need to be deliberate with using it to foster meaningful relationships and towards fulfilling things!
- Writing more about my experience at work and ideas (learning, value, growth, future of our work on the web)
- Really challenging my belief that just becuase I love what I do, I don't need to allow space around it.
- Giving myself credit and valuing my unique skills; not comparing myself harshly with others

Thanks for taking an interest!
