    "This tutorial uses a dataset of 2000 training samples to train the RNN that can be created with the `create_dataset` method defined below. Each sample consists of two 6-bit input numbers ($x_{i1}$, $x_{i2}$) padded with a 0 to make it 7 characters long, and a 7-bit target number ($t_{i}$) so that $t_{i} = x_{i1} + x_{i2}$ ($i$ is the sample index). The numbers are represented as [binary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) with the [most significant bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_significant_bit) on the right (least significant bit first). This is so that our RNN can perform the addition form left to right.\n",

A [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor) is a generalisation of vectors and matrices, a vector is a 1st-order tensor, a matrix is a 2nd-order tensor. The order of a tensor is the dimensionality of the array data structure needed to represent it.   \n",

    "\n",
    "Neural networks typically transform input vectors by matrix multiplication and vector addition followed by a non-linear transfer function. The 2-dimensional input vectors to our network ($x_{ik1}$, $x_{ik2}$) are transformed by a $2 \\times 3$ weight matrix and a bias vector of size 3. Before they can be added to the states of the RNN. The 3-dimensional state vectors are transformed to a 1-dimensional output vector by a $3 \\times 1$ weight matrix and a bias vector of size 1 to give the output probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to process all inputs for each sample and each timestep in one computation we can use the numpy [`tensordot`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.tensordot.html) function to perform the dot products. This function takes 2 tensors and the axes that need to be aggregated by summation between the elements and a product of the result. For example the transformation of input X ($2000 \\times 7 \\times 2$) to the states S ($2000 \\times 7 \\times 3$) with the help of matrix W ($2 \\times 3$) can be done by `S = tensordot(X, W, axes=((-1),(0)))`. This method will sum the elements of the last order (-1) of X with the elements of the first order (0) of W and multiply them together. This is the same as doing the matrix dot product for each [$x_{ik1}$, $x_{ik2}$] vector with W. `tensordot` can then make sure that the underlying computations can be done efficiently and in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "These linear tensor transformations are used to transform the input X to the states S, and from the states S to the output Y. This linear transformation, together with its gradient is implemented in the `TensorLinear` class below. Note that the weights are initialized by sampling uniformly between $\\pm \\sqrt{6.0 / (n_{in} + n_{out})}$ [as suggested by X.

    "\n",
    "Just as in the [previous part]((http://peterroelants.github.io/posts/rnn_implementation_part01/) of this tutorial the recurrent states need to be unfolded through time. This unfolding during [backpropagation through time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation_through_time) is done by the `RecurrentStateUnfold` class. This class holds the shared weight and bias parameters used to update each state, as well as the initial state that is also treated as a parameter and optimized during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward` method of `RecurrentStateUnfold` iteratively updates the states through time and returns the resulting state tensor. The `backward` method propagates the gradients at the outputs of each state backwards through time. Note that at each time $k$ the gradient coming from the output Y needs to be added with the gradient coming from the previous state at time $k+1$. The gradients of the weight and bias parameters are summed over all timestep since they are shared parameters in each state update. The final state gradient at time $k=0$ is used to optimise the initial state $S_0$ since the gradient of the inital state is $\\partial \\xi / \\partial S_{0}$.\n",

    "`RecurrentStateUnfold` makes use of the `RecurrentStateUpdate` class. The `forward` method of this class combines the transformed input and state at time $k-1$ to output state $k$. The `backward` method propagates the gradient backwards through time for one timestep and calculates the gradients of the parameters of this timestep. The non-linear transfer function used in `RecurrentStateUpdate` is the [hyperbolic tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function) (tanh) function. This function, like the logistic function, is a [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) that goes from $-1$ to $+1$. The [tanh function]( https://theclevermachine.wordpress.com/tag/tanh-function/) is chosen because the maximum gradient of this function is higher than the maximum gradient of the [logistic function](http://peterroelants.github.io/posts/neural_network_implementation_part02/#Logistic-function) which make vanishing gradients less likely. This tanh transfer function is implemented in the `TanH` class."

The `forward` method performs the full backpropagation forward step through all layers and timesteps and returns the intermediary outputs. The `backward` method performs the backward step through all layers and timesteps and returns the gradients of all the parameters. The `getParamGrads` method performs both steps and returns the gradients of the parameters in a list. The order of this list corresponds to the order of the iterator returned by `get_params_iter`. The parameters returned in the iterator of that last method are the same as the parameters of the network and can be used to change the parameters of the network manually."

    "## Rmsprop with momentum optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "While the [first part](http://peterroelants.github.io/posts/rnn_implementation_part01/) of this tutorial used [Rprop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rprop) to optimise the network, this part will use the [Rmsprop](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf) algorithm with [Nesterov's accelerated gradient](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/momentum.pdf) to perform the optimisation. We replaced the Rprop algorithm because Rprop doesn't work well with [minibatches](http://peterroelants.github.io/posts/neural_network_implementation_part05/#Stochastic-gradient-descent-backpropagation) due to the stochastic nature of the error surface that can result in sign changes of the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rmsprop algorithm was inspired by the Rprop algorithm. It keeps a [moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) (MA) of the squared gradient for each parameter $\\theta$ ($MA = \\lambda * MA + (1-\\lambda) * (\\partial \\xi / \\partial \\theta)^2$, with $\\lambda$ the moving average hyperparameter). The gradient is then normalised by dividing by the square root of this moving average (`maSquare` = $(\\partial \\xi / \\partial \\theta)/\\sqrt{MA}$). This normalised gradient is then used to update the parameters. Note that if $\\lambda=0$ the gradient is reduced to its sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformed gradient is not used directly to update the parameters, but it is used to update a velocity parameter (`Vs`) for each parameter of the network. This parameter is similar to the velocity parameter from our [previous tutorial](http://peterroelants.github.io/posts/neural_network_implementation_part04/#Backpropagation-updates-with-momentum) but it is used in a slightly different way. Nesterov's accelerated gradient is different from regular momentum in that it applies updates in a different way. While the regular momentum algorithm calculates the gradient at the beginning of the iteration, updates the velocity and moves the parameters according to this velocity, Nesterov's accelerated gradient moves the parameters according to the reduced velocity, then calculates the gradients, updates the velocity, and then moves again according to the local gradient. This has as benefit that the gradient is more informative to do the local update, and can correct for a bad velocity update. The Nesterov updates can be described as:\n",

    "$$\\begin{split}\n",
    "V_{i+1} & = \\lambda V_i - \\mu \\nabla(\\theta_i + \\lambda V_i) \\\\\n",

    "\\end{split}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With $\\nabla(\\theta)$ the local gradient at position $\\theta$ in the parameter space. And $i$ the iteration number. This formula can be visualised as in the following illustration (See [Sutskever I.](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/momentum.pdf)):\n",

    "Note that the training converges to a cost of 0. This convergence is actually not guaranteed. If the parameters of the network start out in a bad position the network might convert to a local minimum that is far from the global minimum. The training is also sensitive to the meta parameters `lmbd`, `learning_rate`, `momentum_term`, `eps`. Try rerunning this yourself to see how many times it actually converges."
