CATNIP Lab is a computational and statistical neuroscience group located in Stony Brook University.
We design __statistical models__ and __machine learning methods__ specialized for analyzing __neural data__.
We aim to understand how information and computations are represented and implemented in the brain, both at a single-neuron and systems level.
We collaborate with experimental labs on important problems in neuroscience, such as sensory coding and perceptual decision-making.
See [research page](research) for details.
