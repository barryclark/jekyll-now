<p>I have learned from <a href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/staff/yaakoub-el-khamra">Mr. Yaakoub El Khamra</a> that he and the good folks at TACC have made some modifications to TACC’s custom MPI implementation and R build in order to correct bugs in Rmpi and snow that were causing crashes. <a href="/parallel-R-on-TACC">My earlier post</a> has been updated to reflect the modifications. The main changes are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The version of MVAPICH2 has changed to 2.0b</li>
<li>Changes to the Rmpi and snow packages necessitate using the latest version of R (Warm Puppy, 3.0.3). This version is available in the <code>Rstats</code> module.</li>
<li>For improved reproducibility, I modified the R code so that the simulation driver function uses a seed value.</li>
<li>I had to switch from <code>maply</code> to <code>mdply</code> as a result of (3).</li>
</ol>
