<p>My article with Larry Hedges and Will Shadish, titled “Design-comparable effect sizes in multiple baseline designs: A general modeling framework” has been accepted at Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics. The abstract is below. Here’s the article at <a href="http://doi.org/10.3102/1076998614547577">the journal website</a>. <a href="/files/Effect-sizes-in-multiple-baseline-designs-JEBS.pdf">Postprint</a> and <a href="/files/Effect-sizes-in-multiple-baseline-designs-Simulation-results.pdf">supporting materials</a> are available. An R package that implements the proposed methods is <a href="/getting-started-with-scdhlm/">available here</a>.</p>
<p><em>In single-case research, the multiple baseline design is a widely used approach for evaluating the effects of interventions on individuals. Multiple baseline designs involve repeated measurement of outcomes over time and the controlled introduction of a treatment at different times for different individuals. This article outlines a general approach for defining effect sizes in multiple baseline designs that are directly comparable to the standardized mean difference from a between-subjects randomized experiment. The target, design-comparable effect size parameter can be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood together with a small-sample correction analogous to Hedges’ g. The approach is demonstrated using hierarchical linear models that include baseline time trends and treatment-by-time interactions. A simulation compares the performance of the proposed estimator to that of an alternative, and an application illustrates the model-fitting process.</em></p>
